The team spotted several mentions of captivity or “ma liberte” – my liberty, and the name “Walsingham”, thought to refer to Sir Francis Walsingham, Queen Elizabeth I’s spymaster. The letters reveal Mary’s distrust of Walsingham and Sir Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, who was a favourite of Elizabeth’s.</p> <p>In the letters, many of which were sent to the French ambassador to England, Michel de Castelnau de Mauvissiere, Mary complained about her poor health, the conditions of her captivity, and spoke about her efforts to negotiate with Elizabeth for her release.

Consequently, we cancelled our strike action in Wales for Monday and Tuesday.</p> <p>“In Scotland, negotiations continue over additional funding for the current year too and there are no planned strikes. Your government looks increasingly isolated in refusing to reopen [talks about pay for] 2022/23.”</p> <p>For weeks the RCN has been making clear it will call off action if the government shows flexibility.

A year ago Andrew paid millions of dollars to settle Giuffre’s claim that she was trafficked to have sex with him on three occasions when she was 17. The settlement did not include any admission of guilt.</p> <p>This weekend, a staged photo was published purporting to undermine Giuffre’s claims of Prince Andrew’s sexual activity with her.</p> <p>The image of a bath in a London townhouse was released by Ian Maxwell, the brother of Ghislaine Maxwell, a former friend of Andrew, who is in jail for sex trafficking offences related to Epstein. It shows two people sitting in the bath of Ghislaine Maxwell’s former flat wearing masks of the duke and Giuffre in an attempt to prove “conclusively that the bath is too small for any sort of sex frolicking” of the sort Giuffre had suggested happened in an unpublished memoir.</p> <p>The gambit comes days after Ghislaine Maxwell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/22/ghislaine-maxwell-prince-andrew-photo-virginia-giuffre-epstein\">claimed</a> in an interview from prison that a photo showing Andrew with his arm around Giuffre’s waist was faked.</p> <p>The staged bath image was dismissed as “insulting” by sources close to Giuffre, who said it “proves nothing”. But asked if Andrew should challenge the settlement he made, Dershowitz said: “I think he should. This may be only the tip of a very deep iceberg. The media should continue to probe every allegation in an effort to get to the truth.”</p> <p>There are also suggestions that other US lawyers are poised to try to help Prince Andrew challenge a legal settlement that has cast him into the royal wilderness. The duke has reportedly consulted the US lawyers Andrew Brettler and Blair Berk over possible legal moves that could assist his rehabilitation.</p> <p>Releasing the bathroom mock-up image, Ian Maxwell told the Daily Telegraph he had not been in contact with Prince Andrew, but offered it as a potential exhibit if it helped his case.</p> <p>Lisa Bloom, a lawyer who has represented victims of the sex trafficking ring operated by Ghislaine Maxwell and the billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein, said the move appeared “desperate”.</p> <p>“The photo shows that two full-sized humans can fit in the bath,” she said, according to the Mail on Sunday. “Virginia said that Andrew began by playing with her feet in the bath. The photo shows that would certainly be possible. Virginia said that she and Andrew then moved into the bedroom where the sexual activity occurred. Nothing in the photo disproves that. Instead of continuing to attack victims, [Maxwell] should be apologising for the pain she has caused to so many.”</p> <p>Andrew’s settlement with Giuffre triggered a stripping of his public duties and royal patronages. At the funeral of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, last September he was denied the right to wear military uniform, unlike his siblings.</p> <p>Charles is already grappling with how to handle Prince Harry’s attendance at the state event after his explosive memoir accused the royals of stereotyping his wife, Meghan, and William of knocking him to the floor in a row.</p> <p>“The king will have been hoping for a quiet run-up to the coronation … untroubled by outside noises,” said a former senior royal aide, who predicted that any rehabilitation attempt by Andrew was likely to fail.</p> <p>“Even if you want to argue about the size of the bath, Andrew made the settlement,” they said. “More than that, he had a long relationship with Epstein culminating in the BBC Newsnight interview [in which he defended staying with Epstein at his New York mansion after Epstein’s conviction for sex offences as ‘the honourable and right thing to do’]. I am sure they will want to continue with the policy of having him as a private member of the family, not living at Buckingham Palace.”</p> <p>Andrew continues to live at Royal Lodge, Windsor, leased from the crown estate. Even before Andrew settled with Giuffre, Charles had been planning a slimmed-down monarchy with fewer key players.</p> <p>Spokespeople for Prince Andrew and Buckingham Palace have been approached for comment.</p>',\n     'wordcount': '800'},\n    'tags': [{'id': 'uk/prince-andrew',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Prince Andrew',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-andrew',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/prince-andrew',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/prince-charles',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'King Charles III',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-charles',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/prince-charles',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/monarchy',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Monarchy',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/monarchy',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/monarchy',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/uk',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'UK news',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk',\n      'references': []}],\n    'isHosted': False,\n    'pillarId': 'pillar/news',\n    'pillarName': 'News'},\n   {'id': 'uk-news/2023/jan/28/gulf-royals-own-more-than-1bn-of-uk-property-via-tax-havens',\n    'type': 'article',\n    'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n    'sectionName': 'UK news',\n    'webPublicationDate': '2023-01-28T07:30:13Z',\n    'webTitle': 'Gulf royals own more than £1bn of UK property via tax havens',\n    'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/28/gulf-royals-own-more-than-1bn-of-uk-property-via-tax-havens',\n    'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/jan/28/gulf-royals-own-more-than-1bn-of-uk-property-via-tax-havens',\n    'fields': {'byline': 'Rob Davies',\n     'body': '<p>The royal families of Gulf states including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar own more than £1bn of UK property via offshore jurisdictions, such as Jersey and the British Virgin Islands, the Guardian can reveal.</p> \\n<p>Nearly 200 properties, including hotels, London mansions and country estates, belong to a few small but super-rich dynasties, according to analysis of a new government register that reveals who is behind offshore companies that own UK property.</p> \\n<p>Gulf royals who hold assets through offshore entities include Sheikh Mansour, the owner of Manchester City football club, members of the Al Saud ruling family of Saudi Arabia, and the al-Thani clan that controls Qatar.</p> \\n<p>The most expensive is a £150m Surrey estate which, according to Land Registry documents, is owned by Sheikh Mansour’s wife, Sheikha Manal bint Mohammed al-Maktoum.</p> \\n<p>Sheikh Mansour, who is the deputy prime minister of the UAE, owns 17 other land titles via Jersey, including a London apartment and land connected to urban developments in Manchester.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abe446cca843a33cd30bece9636a0c0ac19c316d\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abe446cca843a33cd30bece9636a0c0ac19c316d/0_259_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Holme in Regent’s Park, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Holme in Regent’s Park, London.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Guardian</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>The Saudi royal family also holds a vast array of property via offshore entities, including the Holme, a lakeside manor in the middle of London’s Regent’s Park, built in 1818.</p> \\n<p>The property is owned by a Guernsey-based entity, whose beneficial owners include Abdullah bin Khalid Al Saud, the kingdom’s representative at the United Nations.

Holding property through offshore companies is legal. Owners of property through offshore companies may do so for many reasons, from tax benefits to privacy or liking the stability or simplicity of a certain offshore tax regime. In the words of the government, offshore taxation is “complex”.</p>\\n    <p>But ministers have concluded transparency around foreign ownership of UK property is an important step in improving the operation of the tax system. “Whilst the vast majority of people and businesses pay the right amount of tax, mistakes are made,” the government said in its explanation of why the register was being introduced. The register of overseas entities appears to be a big step forward in transparency, with thousands of owners, including the ones reported on by the Guardian, coming forward to declare their properties. All those named as beneficial owners on the register have complied with their legal obligations to declare their holdings. About a quarter of the companies making declarations so far still do not reveal their ownership publicly, because trusts are only required to give information on their beneficiaries to the tax authorities.</p>\\n    <p>The Guardian has previously reported on offshore ownership of companies via leaks such as the Paradise papers and the Pandora papers, leading to governments including the UK government applying greater scrutiny to international tax affairs and offshore secrecy. The Guardian believes shining a light on the property in the UK held through foreign and offshore firms by rich, politically connected and influential people enhances that process of transparency and allows readers to better understand the power structures that affect their daily lives.</p>\\n    <p></p>\\n   </div>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<p>The Guardian is shining a light on owners named on the register in view of the public interest in improving transparency around the ownership of British property. Holding properties through offshore companies is legal and some individuals may have genuine and legitimate privacy or security concerns or business reasons for using them.</p> \\n<p>The register of overseas entities opened last year and individuals have until 31 January to declare they are the beneficial owners of offshore companies that own UK property.</p>',\n     'wordcount': '606'},\n

soldier from the Royal Fusiliers <a href=\"https://blog.hrp.org.uk/curators/a-first-world-war-soldier-who-wished-to-live-as-a-woman-the-story-of-frederick-wright-or-kathleen-woodhouse/\">appeared at Highbury magistrates court</a> charged with desertion and with “being an idle and disorderly person in female attire”. Though the soldier was charged under the name Frederick Wright, they appeared wearing a veiled hat, a wig and makeup, and told the court they wished to be known as Kathleen Woodhouse.</p> <p>The soldier had already appeared in court earlier that year after attempting suicide, which was illegal at the time. They had been ordered to enlist in the army. When arrested for a second time, they had told police: “I wish I had been a woman, as I love wearing beautiful clothes and all my tastes are feminine.”</p> <p>The Royal Fusiliers’ regimental headquarters is at the <a href=\"https://www.hrp.org.uk/tower-of-london/#gs.o8srz9\">Tower of London</a>, which is where a new theatrical tour will tell the story of Woodhouse and other queer histories associated with the tower’s residents and visitors over 700 years.</p> <p>Directed by Tom Latter and written by Chris Bush, an associate director at Sheffield Theatres, <a href=\"https://www.hrp.org.uk/tower-of-london/whats-on/queer-lives-at-the-tower/#gs.o8so84\">Queer Lives</a> will take the form of a promenade performance, and is timed to coincide with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/lgbt-rights\">LGBTQ+</a> history month. Visitors will be led through military battlements, ancient prison cells and a medieval royal bedchamber to hear stories that will be surprising to many, says Matthew Storey, the curator at Historic Royal Palaces whose research underpins the tour.</p> <p>King James I of England may have <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/printed-edition-of-king-james-vi-and-is-basilikon-doron-or-the-kings-gift-1603\">written texts</a> in which he condemned sodomy, says Storey, but “his most significant romantic relationships, aside from the one with his wife, were with men – and that’s something that emerges very early in his life.”</p> <p>Though the nature of the relationships between “Queen James”, as he was nicknamed, and favourites Robert Carr and George Villiers has been debated, “there’s little doubt when you read especially the letters between James and Villiers in particular that the relationship was intensely romantic and physical.”</p> <p>Both royal favourites gained power through their connections to the king, but after Carr was accused of poisoning an opponent who was being held in the tower, he was sidelined, Storey says.</p> <p>As a royal palace as well as a prison, the apartments where some of the king’s assignations would have taken place will form part of the tour; so too will rooms that were the residence of Edward II and his <a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/learn/histories/lgbtq-history/piers-gaveston-hugh-despenser-and-the-downfall-of-edward-ii/#:~:text=Relationship%20with%20Piers%20Gaveston&amp;text=After%20a%20falling%20out%20between,to%20Dover%20with%20two%20minstrels.\">intimate companion Piers Gaveston</a>. “Gaveston was given rooms at the tower that traditionally were given to the queen,” says Storey, “so that gives you a sense of his status.”</p> <p>The pair were accused of sodomy at the time, but putting modern-day labels on historical figures is difficult, he says. “This is such a long time ago, and it’s very difficult to work out if people in the middle ages have the same experiences of gender and sexuality as we do today. But we know same-sex love and desire existed in every single human society.” </p> <p>The tour is not intended to displace better-known histories of the tower, Storey says, but to fill out its history. “These histories of power, the politics of oppression, or of triumph, go absolutely to the heart of human experience. When we’re talking about the power play of the medieval court, or the Jacobean court, they are absolutely central to understanding of what was actually happening at that time. If you take out these histories, you’ll you’re not going to get the complete picture or understanding of what was happening.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 27 January 2023.

As such, it would potentially apply in future to cases such as those involving “spy cops”, in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/14/high-court-dismisses-womans-attempt-to-prosecute-police-spy\">undercover police officers adopted fake personas and conducted sexual affairs with female activists</a>.</p> <p>In another example cited in the report by the <a href=\"http://www.clrnn.co.uk/\">Criminal Law Reform Now Network</a>, based at Birmingham University, a man who lied to his sexual partner that he had had a vasectomy had his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/rape\">rape</a> conviction <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/23/judges-rule-lying-about-fertility-to-sexual-partner-is-not\">overturned on appeal</a> after judges ruled that she was not deceived as to the “sexual intercourse itself” but only as to the “broad circumstances’” surrounding it. They determined this did not undermine consent.</p> <p>Members of the CRLN Network say courts struggle to say which deceptions have the effect of nullifying the supposed consent of the victim and which do not, meaning there is an urgent need for reform. Its “straightforward” solution is for a bespoke offence.</p> <p>John Child, co-director at the CLRN Network and professor of criminal law at the University of Birmingham, said: “It would have to be something where you’re deceiving somebody and the intention is to induce a sexual activity by that deception. But not only that, you have to know as the defendant that what you’re saying is important to that other party.</p> <p>“So if it’s just part of your sort of chat-up lines, that’s one thing but if you know, for example, the person is wearing, let’s say, religious dress and so it becomes obvious that your religion will will be very important to them, then acts of deception as to that aspect is much more likely of course to then lead to the offence being committed.”</p> <p>The CRLN Network has fully drafted the new offence, which it proposes should be added to the existing <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/contents\">Sexual Offences Act 2003</a> and carry a maximum jail term of 10 years.</p> <p>Child said the team of experts decided against drawing up a list of exemptions for certain kinds of deception they struggled to see who had the right to make such a list and on what basis. However, the report, <a href=\"http://www.clrnn.co.uk/publications-reports/\">published on Wednesday</a>, states that “we should not assume that all deceptions would lead inexorably to liability”, citing the example of “exaggeration or flattery which might be common in flirtatious interaction”. Additionally, as well as the requirement for the accused to know that the deception would be important to the other party, it also provides them with a “reasonable excuse” exemption.</p> <p>Child said: “This is a lesson we’re trying to get across to young men in particular, of different ages and I think a sort of headline new offence, which really focuses on this idea there are there are unacceptable limits of deception when trying to induce someone to have sex, is a sensible conversation to be having.”</p> <p>A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “Courts already consider all relevant factors which could affect whether consent was given but we keep sexual offence legislation under constant review to ensure the public is protected.”</p>',\n     'wordcount': '546'},\n    'tags': [{'id': 'uk/ukcrime',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Crime',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/ukcrime',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/ukcrime',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'law/law',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'law',\n      'sectionName': 'Law',\n      'webTitle': 'Law',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/law/law',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/law/law',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/uk',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'UK news',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'society/rape',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'society',\n      'sectionName': 'Society',\n      'webTitle': 'Rape and sexual assault',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/rape',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/society/rape',\n      'references': []}],\n    'isHosted': False,\n    'pillarId': 'pillar/news',\n    'pillarName': 'News'},\n   {'id': 'uk-news/2023/jan/17/westminster-block-on-scotlands-gender-recognition-bill-may-be-gift-to-the-snp',\n    'type': 'article',\n    'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n    'sectionName': 'UK news',\n    'webPublicationDate': '2023-01-17T19:18:40Z',\n    'webTitle': 'Westminster block on Scotland’s gender recognition bill may be gift to the SNP',\n    'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/17/westminster-block-on-scotlands-gender-recognition-bill-may-be-gift-to-the-snp',\n    'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/jan/17/westminster-block-on-scotlands-gender-recognition-bill-may-be-gift-to-the-snp',\n    'fields': {'byline': 'Libby Brooks Scotland correspondent',\n     'body': '<p>“I honestly can’t tell if I’m angry or exhausted, probably a mix,” said Arabel, one of a group of young trans Scots who shared their experiences with MSPs last year as the Holyrood parliament considered the gender recognition reform bill.</p> <p>The group’s frustration and weariness was palpable on Wednesday morning, following the announcement from Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, that he will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/16/rishi-sunak-blocks-scotlands-gender-recognition-legislation\">block the bill</a> – which simplifies the system by which transgender individuals change their gender and lowers the age of application to 16.</p> <p>“I can’t even be angry, it’s just stupid, said 18-year-old Sid. “The UK government are making a great case for independence: they’re showing a complete lack of respect towards both trans people and Scotland.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/17/uk-government-formally-blocks-scotlands-gender-recognition-legislation\">Court battle looms as UK ministers block Scottish gender recognition law</a> </p> </aside>  <p>MSPs who sat through days of fraught and often emotional debate in the Scottish parliament at the end of last year, including unprecedented early hours sittings and protests inside the chamber, were watching events unfold in Westminster on Wednesday afternoon. Jack formally blocked the law that would have made Scotland the first part of the UK to introduce a system of self-identification for those wanting to change gender.</p> <p>“It was like we were right back where we started,” said one MSP who was heavily involved in the nuanced and respectful cross-party brokering of amendments that characterised the final days of the bill, evidence of the steep learning curve Holyrood has been on over the past year.</p> <p>The phrasing used on social media by SNP politicians following Jack’s announcement was telling: “Whatever you think about the bill itself, this is a denial of democracy” – a phrase first coined by Nicola Sturgeon after last October’s supreme court ruling that Holyrood could not legislate for a second independence referendum without Westminster approval.</p> <p>Critics of the bill say that this is a legal, not a democratic issue, and that the UK government had no choice but to resort to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/17/scotland-gender-recognition-bill-what-is-a-section-35-order\">section 35</a> of the Scotland Act after the Scottish government ignored prior interventions. Gender critical groups including For Women Scotland point out that concerns about the Equality Act were raised repeatedly, including by the UK equalities watchdog.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/17/sixteen-is-old-enough-to-decide-on-gender-says-education-secretary\">Mixed signals from No 10 and education secretary over gender change age </a> </p> </aside>  <p>The use of a section 35 order has frequently been described as “the nuclear option”, although the architects of devolution were clear at the time of drafting the act that is was a necessary addition.</p> <p>But as Kenneth Armstrong, professor of European law at the University of Cambridge, points out, previous UK government challenges to Holyrood – such as post-Brexit frameworks, incorporation of UN rights or the referendum – were all done through the courts, requiring days of hearings and evidence. “To have a minister of the crown block this bill feels very different, and pitches parliamentary decision-making versus the executive in a fairly dramatic way.”</p> <p>Certainly Jack’s move is a useful distraction for the SNP leadership from the muddle around plans to run the next election as a de facto referendum – there was heavy criticism after a meeting of the party’s national executive committee last weekend appeared to roll back on the proposal.</p> <p>When Sturgeon first proposed this reform in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/01/nicola-sturgeon-gender-recognition-law-trans-people-scotland-snp-lgbti\">advance of the 2016 Holyrood election</a> it was considered an incremental step along what she regarded as a progressive path of equalities law. She could not have anticipated the accelerating culture war that would distort and conflate matters down the line – a number of MSPs speak wistfully of the alternative history where the bill was passed soon after 2016 with minimal opposition or consequence.</p> <p>Following the supreme court’s ruling in November that a referendum on Scottish independence cannot take place without Westminster agreement, polls indicated a boost in support for independence in Scotland. But polling expert Sir John Curtice refers to YouGov and Panelbase polls for the Times and Sunday Times in December as evidence that the Scottish government has failed to persuade the public on the detail of gender recognition reforms, and believes this is likely to cancel out any immediate bump in independence support.</p> <p>Longer term there are concerns, even among Scottish Conservatives, about the UK government’s strategy. Jamie Greene, who broke ranks with his party to support the bill, wrote to the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, at the weekend warning him that blocking the bill would be “a gift to proponents of independence”.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Scottish Labour finds itself in a familiar bind after UK leader Keir Starmer told reporters he believed that 16-year-olds weren’t old enough to decide to change gender, diverging from what the majority of Holyrood colleagues had voted for a few weeks prior.</p> <p>In private, there are those in the SNP and Labour who still worry that the bill raises collateral issues, and that Holyrood still lacks a full understanding of its engagement with the Equality Act, though few agree that a section 35 order is the way to facilitate this, expressing disappointment that an opportunity for legal clarity will probably be drowned out by further political posturing.</p>',\n     'wordcount': '813'},\n    'tags': [{'id': 'uk/scotland',\n      'type':

and social care secretary Steve Barclay has privately urged trade unions to help him make the case to the Treasury and No 10 for extra money for nurses, ambulance workers and other NHS staff in an extraordinary twist to the escalating crisis over health service strikes, the <em>Observer</em> can reveal.</p> <p>A serious cabinet split has opened up, with Barclay now wanting more money for all NHS staff except doctors – while Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, are refusing to budge from their insistence that no more can be offered.</p> <p>Barclay’s call for the unions to help him present a convincing case to Sunak and Hunt was made at a meeting between the unions and ministers last Monday.</p> <p>Sara Gorton, head of health at Unison, who chairs the 14-strong NHS group of unions, and who was present, told the <em>Observer</em>: “On Monday he talked about asking us to help make the case to the Treasury for the investment needed.”</p> <p>Gorton said that after weeks of stonewalling Barclay’s tone was “very different” in the meeting and that he was willing to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/12/steve-barclay-privately-concedes-he-will-have-to-increase-pay-offer-to-nhs-staff\">talk about more pay</a>, including for this year.</p> <p>But just as surprising to union leaders was that Barclay requested help from the unions to make an argument to Hunt and Sunak that more money would help stop the rapid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/23/thousands-of-nhs-workers-may-quit-for-better-paid-jobs-ministers-warned\">exodus of NHS staff </a>to other jobs, and increase efficiency. “He asked for our assistance in making the case about how improving pay and investing in the workforce could lead to greater efficiencies and productivity.”</p> <p>Gorton, who has been involved in every pay round on behalf of Unison members in the NHS for the past 20 years, explained that in order to reach deals with Conservative governments she had found that ministers needed to be able to convince the Treasury that any extra money spent would lead to savings in the medium and longer term. “All of the agreements I have been involved with in the past have involved a certain amount of showing the benefits of investing,” she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aafa5253992422204df0de975b7097d19e424cd9\"> <img

<span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“He [Barclay] offered to be the advocate for health workers inside the cabinet. My interpretation of what he said was that he was prepared to make the case for us for investment in pay.”</p> <p>Gorton has written to Barclay this weekend asking him to organise a meeting with the prime minister, the chancellor and Unison’s general secretary Christina McAnea. The aim, she said, would be to secure extra funding for an improved settlement for NHS staff from outside existing budgets.</p> <p>Gorton’s account was confirmed last night by senior Whitehall officials who had been briefed on the meeting, as well as several other sources from the health unions.</p> <p>One Whitehall official briefed on the discussions said: “Everything Sara Gorton has said in public has turned out to be fair and accurate and this is a true reflection of what was said in the meeting.”</p> <p>Downing Street said No 10 and the Treasury continued to hold the view that ministers would not move beyond the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/dec/29/revealed-executives-who-determine-public-sector-pay\">pay review body</a> recommendations, although a spokesman said Barclay had made clear that his “door was open” for more talks. No 10 said it would respond to the letter from Gorton.</p> <p>The <em>Observer</em> understands that while Barclay has stuck doggedly to the official government line for months, he made the case inside government for higher pay for NHS staff early on in the dispute, only to be told by the Treasury that making an exception for NHS workers would lead to rash of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/nov/27/public-sector-pay-demands-unaffordable-says-transport-secretary-winter-strikes\">other unaffordable claims</a> across the public sector.</p> <p>Barclay is now understood to be concerned that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/02/britain-nhs-crisis-war-footing-pandemic\">NHS’s capacity crisis</a>, and lengthening <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/12/ae-patients-in-england-waiting-over-12-hours-top-50000-for-first-time\">waiting times for ambulances</a>, could lead to the collapse of the service and more staff quitting.</p> <p>With the unions feeling increasingly confident that they are winning the argument, the Royal College of Nursing said last night that it would pull double the number of nurses out on strike in February compared with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/dec/20/nurse-strike-england-wales-northern-ireland-second-day\">previous strikes</a> before Christmas, and involve more hospitals.</p> <p>The latest Opinium poll for the <em>Observer</em> shows that public support for nurses and ambulance staff remains solid, with many more voters blaming the government for the crisis than the unions. Some 57% of voters supported nurses striking, compared with 31% who opposed the action. Striking ambulance staff were backed by 52%, against 35% who opposed them taking action.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c46baa78a57226aec8a18cd10c8c2b51e199ed9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c46baa78a57226aec8a18cd10c8c2b51e199ed9a/0_274_8192_4915/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ambulance staff on the picket lines in Keighley, West Yorkshire, on the second day of walkouts last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ambulance staff on the picket lines in Keighley, West Yorkshire, on the second day of walkouts last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Adam Drummond of Opinium said: “The government will be disappointed if it was hoping the public would blame striking nurses and ambulance workers for the situation in the NHS. Although support for strikes in general has fallen slightly since before Christmas, the public are still overwhelmingly supportive.”</p> <p>Despite Sunak’s attempts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/07/the-guardian-view-on-sunak-and-the-strikes-misreading-the-mood-of-the-nation\">make political capital</a> from the crisis by claiming Labour is in the pockets of the striking unions, Keir Starmer’s party has increased its lead over the Tories in the Christmas period. Labour is on 45% (+1) compared with the Conservatives, who are unchanged on 29% since three weeks ago.</p> <p>The nurses’ strike will continue this week with staff at more than 70 NHS trusts in England that were not part of December’s first wave of industrial action walking out on Wednesday and Thursday. The RCN will announce new strike dates for the start of February in the 48 hours before its second strike this week.</p> <p>Nurses’ leaders said that if progress was not made in negotiations by the end of January, the strikes in February would include all eligible members in England for the first time. Pat Cullen, general secretary of the RCN, said: “The public supports nurses because of just how much nurses give to the public. Rishi Sunak’s intransigence is baffling, reckless and politically ill-considered.”</p>',\n     'wordcount': '948'},\n    'tags': [{'id': 'uk-news/industrial-action',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n

The queen’s parents stood by the rest of us all through the second world war and they earned the right, along with their daughter, to our gratitude. I was born in Maidstone, Kent, in April 1939 and I never begrudged the queen her peaceful reign.</p> <p>It’s over now. King Charles III should realise that he and his bickering family can never step into the space left by Queen Elizabeth II. <br><strong>Margaret Gagie</strong><br><em>London, Ontario, Canada</em></p> <p>• Polly Toynbee’s wonderful piece truly describes the state of affairs. She absolutely nailed it when she wrote that we foreigners might enjoy the royal sideshow just because it is funny and absurd and – thank God – happening somewhere else. It’s true that there are other monarchies in Europe – I lived in one – but those are low-key, sober and consist of only a handful of individuals often with regular jobs, with none of the outdated pomp and pageantry of the UK.</p> <p>That said, the mass mourning for the late queen, which reminded me of the hysteria around the passing of Ayatollah Khomeini years ago, showed that the British public seem happy with the status quo where the monarchy is concerned.<br><strong>Matilde Alessandra<br></strong><em>New York City, US</em></p> <p>• Polly Toynbee must have been watching a different ITV interview from the one I saw. I heard none of the “inchoate rage” to which she refers, but rather an eloquent, articulate young man calmly explaining why he needed to speak out on behalf of himself and his wife. Toynbee’s anti-royalist agenda perhaps closed her ears to what was actually said.<br><strong>Jennifer Jenkins</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>• Prince Harry’s book will not bring down the monarchy. Although it has not had any meaningful power since the Act of Settlement more than 300 years ago, it justifies the inherited wealth and power of the aristocracy of the UK. History shows us the danger intrinsic in the power vacuum that has followed the overthrow of a monarch.

This is absolutely surreal.”</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/10/spare-prince-harry-review-attempt-reclaim-narrative\">Spare by Prince Harry review – a flawed attempt to reclaim the narrative</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>Harry’s book, Spare, went on sale on Tuesday. The publisher, Transworld Penguin Random House, said 400,000 hardback, e-book and audio copies were sold in the UK on the first day alone. Harry had promoted it via interviews on Britain’s ITV and America’s current affairs series <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCOojny1-fM\">60 Minutes</a>, which enjoyed its best audience of the season with a total of 11.2 million viewers.</p> \\n<p>But an appearance on <a href=\"https://www.cbs.com/shows/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert/\">The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</a> on CBS represented more of a gamble. Colbert once roasted President George W Bush at the annual White House correspondents’ dinner and has built a TV career mercilessly lampooning politicians and the news media.</p> \\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the host could not resist picking up on a passage in which Harry, 38, describes how a visit to the north pole left him with mild frostbite in his penis that lingered during his brother’s wedding to Kate.</p> \\n<p>“Can you explain how it is that the royal standard got frostnip?” Colbert asked with evident relish. “Walk us through it. Take all the time in the world.”</p> \\n<p>Harry replied: “Can I have a drink? How long have you been waiting to ask that question?”</p> \\n<p>Colbert said: “Since I read the book yesterday.”</p> \\n<p>In what is safe to assume is a first for a member of the royal family, Harry said: “We’ve taken quite a leap from grief and trauma to my todger.”</p> \\n<p>Colbert said: “Todger. That’s a very gentle word. Todger. Sounds like a nice nickname. You know, my friends, here’s Willy, here’s todger, here’s John Thomas.”</p> \\n<p>He then asked: “How did it get frost nipped? Why did you not take care of the royal jewels?”</p> \\n<p>Harry laughed and said the context was important. Colbert said: “The context of this is that you’re going to the north pole and things got very cold. At what point did you realise there was a crisis at the south pole?”</p> \\n<p>The audience roared. Harry insisted: “It didn’t turn into an icicle.” He explained that he had joined military veterans on a walk to the north pole and had brought all the right equipment except a “cock cushion” to keep warm.</p> \\n<p>The show had also begun on a lighthearted note as Harry was greeted by two trumpeters in uniform at the CBS Studios in New York. He said: “Stephen, not needed, but thank you, I appreciate it.” Colbert replied: “What are you talking about? This isn’t for you. Wait, out of the way. He’s coming!” Hollywood star Tom Hanks then appeared and Harry threw petals over him.</p> \\n<p>Later Colbert poured Harry a glass of tequila and learned that he watches and “fact-checks” the Netflix drama series The Crown. But he did also cover serious territory, asking whether Harry thinks the royal family is actively campaigning to undermine the book.</p> \\n<p>“Of course,” he said, adding that the British media was doing the same. “But this is the other side of the story, right? After 38 years, they have told their side of the story. This is the other side of the story and there’s a lot in there that, perhaps makes people feel uncomfortable and scared.”</p> \\n<p>Harry gave the example of his recollections of serving in the British army in Afghanistan. He writes that on his second tour, as an Apache helicopter co-pilot and gunner, he killed 25 Taliban militants, feeling neither satisfaction nor shame about his actions. Some veterans and military leaders have said publishing a head count <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/06/army-veterans-criticise-prince-harry-claim-killed-25-taliban-afghanistan\">violates an unspoken military code</a>, potentially increasing the security risk for Harry and British forces.</p> \\n<p>Questioned by Colbert, the duke defended the disclosure and claimed that it had been distorted by the media without context. “Without doubt, the most dangerous lie that they have told is that I somehow boasted about the number of people that I killed in Afghanistan.”</p> \\n<p>He continued: “I would say that if I heard anybody else or heard anyone boasting about that kind of thing, I would be angry. But it’s a lie and hopefully now that the book is out, people will be able to see the context. It’s really troubling and very disturbing that they can get away with it because they had the context. It wasn’t like here’s just one line. They had the whole section. They ripped it away and just said, here it is, he’s boasting on this … and that’s dangerous. And my words are not dangerous but the spin of my words are very dangerous.”</p> \\n<p>Colbert asked: “Dangerous because it makes you an increased target – those around you that you love?”</p> \\n<p>Harry agreed and said: “That is a choice they’ve made.”</p> \\n<p>The duke explained that his motive, having spent nearly two decades working with veterans all around the world, was to be honest and share experiences without shame. “My whole goal and my attempt with sharing that detail is to reduce the number of suicides.”</p> \\n<p>In the book, Harry recounts how his father broke the news of the death of his mother, Diana, but did not offer a hug. He also shares details about his anger at the British media and his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/04/prince-harry-william-physical-attack-2019-meghan-spare-book\">strained relationship with William</a> and his wider family, which worsened after he began a relationship with Meghan Markle, the mixed-race American actor whom he married in 2018.</p> \\n<p>As Colbert delved into this aspect, Harry joked to the studio audience: “A little bit like group therapy.”</p> \\n<p>Colbert himself was 10 when he lost his father and two teenage brothers in a plane crash. He has discussed grief with interviewees including Joe Biden and the CNN host Anderson Cooper. He asked Harry: “If your mother were still alive, do you ever think about how she might handle this moment?”</p> \\n<p>Harry answered: “It’s impossible to say where we would be now, where those relationships would be now, but there is no way that the distance between my brother and I would be the same.” He said he had felt Diana’s presence more in the last two years than in the last 30.</p> \\n<p>He reflected: “She died at 36 and I was 36 when this all kicked off, as in January of 2020 was when my wife and I basically said enough, we can’t cope, we can’t deal with this, we need to carve out something different. So that was an interesting overlap of time.”</p>',\n     'wordcount': '1164'},\n    'tags': [{'id': 'uk/prince-harry',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Prince Harry',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-harry',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/prince-harry',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'culture/television',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'tv-and-radio',\n      'sectionName': 'Television & radio',\n      'webTitle': 'Television',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/culture/television',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/television',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'tv-and-radio/stephen-colbert',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'tv-and-radio',\n      'sectionName': 'Television & radio',\n      'webTitle': 'Stephen Colbert',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/stephen-colbert',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/stephen-colbert',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'culture/culture',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'culture',\n      'sectionName': 'Culture',\n      'webTitle': 'Culture',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'tv-and-radio',\n      'sectionName': 'Television & radio',\n      'webTitle': 'Television & radio',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/uk',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'UK news',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/monarchy',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Monarchy',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/monarchy',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/monarchy',\n      'references': []}],\n    'isHosted': False,\n    'pillarId': 'pillar/news',\n    'pillarName': 'News'},\n   {'id': 'uk-news/2023/jan/09/prince-harry-says-any-return-to-royal-fold-would-be-unsurvivable-camilla',\n    'type': 'article',\n    'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n    'sectionName': 'UK news',\n    'webPublicationDate': '2023-01-09T17:43:13Z',\n    'webTitle': 'Prince Harry says any return to royal fold would be ‘unsurvivable’',\n    'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/09/prince-harry-says-any-return-to-royal-fold-would-be-unsurvivable-camilla',\n    'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/jan/09/prince-harry-says-any-return-to-royal-fold-would-be-unsurvivable-camilla',\n    'fields': {'byline': 'Caroline Davies, and Joanna Walters in New York',\n     'body': '<p>Prince Harry has described how he “can’t ever get out” of the royal family, but he does not believe it will ever be possible for him and the Duchess of Sussex to return to the UK as working royals.</p> <p>In his latest TV interview to promote his autobiography Spare, the Duke of Sussex continued to point the finger at Camilla, the Queen Consort, over allegations he had been “sacrificed on her personal PR altar”.</p> <p>Asked on Good Morning America if the couple could return to the royal fold, he said he did not think “it’s ever going to be possible”.</p> <p>“Even if there is an agreement, or an arrangement between me and my family, there is that third party that is going to do everything they can to make sure that isn’t possible,” he told host Michael Strahan, implying he was referring to the media and competing royal press offices. “Not stopping us going back, but making it unsurvivable.”</p> <p>He said he believed his late mother would be heartbroken over the rift that has developed between him and his brother William, the Prince of Wales. “I think she would be sad … I think she would be heartbroken.”</p> <p>He insisted his late grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, was not upset at him wanting to step down as a working royal. “She knew what was going on. She knew how hard it was. I don’t know whether she was in a position to change it,” he said.</p> <p>He added: “She never said to me that she was angry.

But he told Strahan he also sympathised with her, saying she was not an “evil stepmother”.</p> <p>Strahan read an extract from Harry’s book critical of Camilla. “In a funny way I even wanted Camilla to be happy. Maybe she’d be less dangerous if she was happy.”</p> <p>Another excerpt said: “I have complex feelings about gaining a step-parent who I thought had recently sacrificed me on her personal PR altar.”</p> <p>Asked what Camilla had “done” at that point, Harry replied: “I have a huge amount of compassion for her, you know. Being the third person within my parents’ marriage and she had a reputation, or an image, to rehabilitate. Whatever conversations happened, whatever deals or trading was made right at the beginning, she was led to believe that that would be the best way of doing it.”</p> <p>He said they had not spoken in a “long time” but were “perfectly pleasant” to each other when they did meet. “She’s my stepmother,” he said. “I don’t look at her as an evil stepmother. I see someone who married into this institution and has done everything that she can to improve her own reputation and her own image for her own sake.”</p> <p>In a previous separate interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, Harry had said Camilla’s willingness to forge relationships with the British press made her “dangerous” and there would be “bodies left in the street because of that”.</p> <p>He told ABC he was “stunned” that public funding of security for him and his family was withdrawn after he left Britain.</p> <p>In his interview with ITV on Sunday, Harry denied he and Meghan had called an unnamed member of the royal family racist after they questioned what skin colour their son Archie might be.

Here are some of the key details.</p> \\n<h2>Why he wrote the book</h2> \\n<p>Prince Harry framed the decision to write an autobiography as a last resort, driven by the failure of the royal family to hear his concerns, in particular over alleged briefings to the tabloid press. And he suggested that it was a reclamation of his life story.</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/08/harry-the-interview-review-so-horribly-sad-it-could-have-turned-the-queen-anti-monarchy\">Harry: The Interview review – so horribly sad it could have turned the Queen anti-monarchy</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>“38 years of having my story told by so many different people with an intentional spin and distortion – it felt like a good time to own my story,” he told ITV’s Tom Bradby. “I have … [been] doing everything that I can privately to get through to my family. And the thing that is the saddest about this, Tom, is it never needed to be this way. It never needed to get to this point.”</p> \\n<p>He told CBS’s Anderson Cooper that “none of anything that I’ve written … is ever intended to hurt my family” but the book should squash “this idea that somehow my wife was the one that destroyed the relationship between these two brothers”. </p> \\n<p>He said on ITV that criticism of his decisions to write it were misplaced: “I’m not sure how honesty is burning bridges. Silence only allows the abuser to abuse.”</p> \\n<h2>The death of Diana</h2> \\n<p>The gut-wrenching discussion of the trauma of his mother’s death, and its very long aftermath, started with a passage from the book: his father sitting on his bed, putting his hand on his knee, and calling him “darling boy” as he broke the news. Harry told Bradby that he had very few memories from before that day: “I lost a lot of memories on the other side of this mental wall, which I think is so relatable for so many people who’ve experienced loss … that inability to be able to drag the memories back over.”</p> \\n<p>He told CBS that he didn’t believe Diana was dead “for a long time”, and talked about his continued belief that the role of the paparazzi in causing the accident has not been fully acknowledged. “Everybody got away with it,” he said.</p> \\n<h2>His relationship with Charles and William</h2> \\n<p>“I love my father. I love my brother. I love my family,” Harry told ITV. “I always do.” Nonetheless, his criticisms of their handling of the rift in the family were stringent: “Going back to the relationship between certain members of the family and the tabloid press, those certain members have decided to get into bed with the devil, to rehabilitate their image,” he said.</p> \\n<p>It was hard not to link those lines to other allegations that, for example, there had been a refusal to correct claims that Meghan had made Kate cry ahead of Meghan and Harry’s wedding when “they were more than happy to put out statements for less volatile things”.</p> \\n<p>Harry also said on CBS that when the Queen was dying, he had not been invited on a private flight taking other family members to her bedside at Balmoral. By the time he arrived separately, she was dead.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5e1aac46e31cda9b8f408034e2ff4ddb0402d15\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5e1aac46e31cda9b8f408034e2ff4ddb0402d15/0_0_3500_2327/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Duke and Duchess of Sussex, walking down the steps of St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle after their wedding.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Duke and Duchess of Sussex, walking down the steps of St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle after their wedding.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<h2>His controversial beard</h2> \\n<p>Easily the weirdest feature of the ITV interview was an in-depth discussion of the politics surrounding his wish to keep his beard for his wedding to Meghan (<em>above</em>) – either telling evidence of the monarchy’s obsessive desire to control even the smallest details of his life, or of a disproportionate grudge over a deeply trivial matter, depending on your sympathies.</p> \\n<p>He prevailed in the end. “Writing this, I remembered that William had a beard himself, and granny [the Queen] and other people were the ones to tell him that you have to shave it off,” he said. The difference in his case, he said, was that his beard was representative of “the new Harry – almost like a shield to my anxiety … and I think William found it hard.” He added: “Hopefully those beard people out there will go, yeah no, I fully get that.”</p> \\n<h2>Therapy</h2> \\n<p>Therapy’s influence on Harry’s thinking came through again and again. When reflecting on his claims of being physically attacked by his brother, he told ITV: “I can pretty much guarantee today that if I wasn’t doing therapy sessions … I would have fought back 100%. But I didn’t, because I was in a more comfortable place with my own anger.”</p> \\n<p>In another apparent reference to the value of a process he started seven years ago, he said: “I have put in a lot of work and effort into resolving my own trauma from many, many years ago, and I will continue to work on that. And I think other people within my family could do with that support as well.” He said on CBS that the therapeutic use of psychedelics had helped “clear the windscreen … the misery of loss”. </p> \\n<p>He told Bradby, “I’m very happy, I’m very at peace. I’m in a better place than I’ve ever been … I’m in such a good headspace now.”</p> \\n<h2>The press and royal briefings</h2> \\n<p>Harry cast his ongoing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/oct/06/doreen-lawrence-prince-harry-and-others-launch-legal-action-against-daily-mail-publisher?{{url_parameters_unstripped}}\">legal battles with parts of the press</a> over alleged phone hacking and other invasions of his privacy as a patriotic crusade. “If I can’t continue to serve my country while based in the UK … then I will continue to serve my country from abroad,” he said. “Changing the media … [that’s how] I am going to try to make a difference.”</p> \\n<p>He came back repeatedly to the idea that his family and the press have a toxic, and symbiotic, relationship. “My family have tried to control it for years, and they still try to control it … But it’s something they don’t want to change because it benefits them.” He told ITV: “What people are starting to understand now is that a royal source is not an unknown person. It is the palace specifically briefing the press, but covering their tracks by being unnamed.”</p> \\n<p>On CBS, Harry spoke of Buckingham Palace’s failure to condemn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/dec/18/jeremy-clarkson-condemned-meghan-column-the-sun#:~:text=In%20an%20article%20for%20the,lumps%20of%20excrement%20at%20her%E2%80%9D.?{{url_parameters_unstripped}}\">a column by Jeremy Clarkson in the Sun</a> about Meghan, in which Clarkson said he was “dreaming of the day when she is made to parade naked through the streets of every town in Britain”: “There comes a point where silence is betrayal,” he said.</p> \\n<h2>Reconciliation</h2> \\n<p>Despite his book’s many incendiary revelations and allegations, Harry insisted that his primary goal was reconciliation with his family. “I want reconciliation,” he told Bradby. “But first, there needs to be some accountability.” Later, he told CBS, he was “trying to speak a language that perhaps they understand”.</p> \\n<p>He said on ITV that he “100%” believed reconciliation was still possible, but that “they feel as though it’s better to keep us somehow as the villains”. Such an outcome could have a remarkable impact, he said: “I genuinely believe, and I hope, that reconciliation between my family and us will have a ripple effect across the entire world.”</p>',\n     'wordcount': '1182'},\n    'tags': [{'id': 'uk/prince-harry',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Prince Harry',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-harry',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/prince-harry',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'media/itv-news',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'media',\n      'sectionName': 'Media',\n      'webTitle': 'ITV News',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/media/itv-news',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/media/itv-news',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'media/cbs',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'media',\n      'sectionName': 'Media',\n      'webTitle': 'CBS',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/media/cbs',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/media/cbs',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'media/media',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'media',\n      'sectionName': 'Media',\n      'webTitle': 'Media',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/media/media',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/media/media',\n      'references': []}],\n    'isHosted': False,\n    'pillarId': 'pillar/news',\n    'pillarName': 'News'},\n   {'id': 'uk-news/2023/jan/08/harrys-book-end-of-monarchy-royal-biographer',\n    'type': 'article',\n    'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n    'sectionName': 'UK news',\n    'webPublicationDate': '2023-01-08T09:00:44Z',\n    'webTitle': 'Prince Harry’s book could be ‘beginning of end’ for royals, warns Charles’s biographer',\n    'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/08/harrys-book-end-of-monarchy-royal-biographer',\n    'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/jan/08/harrys-book-end-of-monarchy-royal-biographer',\n    'fields': {'byline': 'Vanessa Thorpe',\n     'body': '<p>The “absolutely catastrophic” implications of attacks on the behaviour of the royal family in the new memoir from the Duke of Sussex are being ignored, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/catherine-mayer\">Catherine Mayer</a>, the royal analyst and biographer of King Charles.</p> <p>Early publication of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/06/prince-harry-book-leaks-let-papers-have-their-cake-and-eat-it\">Spanish edition of </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/06/prince-harry-book-leaks-let-papers-have-their-cake-and-eat-it\">Spare</a></em> has put the focus on personality clashes, some of it fed by the royal publicity machine, and this could threaten the constitutional monarchy, whether or not the British public is calling for such a change, Mayer believes.</p> <p>“It is possibly something that will mark the beginning of the end of the monarchy, and that is what we should discuss. It is important, given the lack of trust in the state at the moment and an upsurge in rightwing politics. Members of the royal family have become our proxies for anger about racism, misogyny and wealth. This is, after all, an institution that stands for inequality, so there are huge things at stake.”</p> <p>Mayer, whose book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/12/charles-the-heart-of-a-king-catherine-mayer-review-will-self\">The Heart of a King</a></em> was subject to similar pre-publication security leaks and distortion when it came out in 2015, argues that fundamental questions raised by Harry in his Netflix series and new book, in addition to his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/mar/08/meghan-and-prince-harry-oprah-winfrey-interview-special-12-things-we-learned\">interviews with Oprah Winfrey</a> and with ITV’s Tom Bradby on Sunday, are being dodged. Accusations of bullying, racism and misogyny, as well as the class distinctions shored up by the monarchy, will eventually combine to undermine the basis of the consent by which the royal family rule, if they are not addressed, she predicts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f1810bc18ef6ccf09c5978794fff7c958e6a4d2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1810bc18ef6ccf09c5978794fff7c958e6a4d2d/0_991_2925_2925/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Catherine Mayer, whose book, The Heart of a King, was published in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catherine Mayer, whose book The Heart of a King was published in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“There is a general misapprehension that this is a light story about a British tourist attraction. The polarisation on both sides of the row is styled as a defence of the monarchy, but it’s not that,” said Mayer. “This is not just a celebrity knockabout story. What we are talking about is the status of a significant institution of state, with significant powers and significant taxpayer funding, so whether you are pro- or anti-monarchy, it deserves to be considered seriously.”</p> <p>The author first condemned the confrontational tone of much media coverage of the dispute <a href=\"https://twitter.com/catherine_mayer/status/1611623883169271810?s=20&amp;t=Yx3bnQ5EhPdvG3LqI5JN9A%20[Pls%20keep,%20Mayer%20requests]\">in a tweet on Saturday morning</a>, writing “It’s as if UK journalism, stung by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PrinceHarry?src=hashtag_click\">#PrinceHarry</a>’s criticisms, went down the pub, chugged 17 pints of lager top, and came out swinging, staggering and shouting ‘you think *that* was bad!? Just you watch!’ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Spare?src=hashtag_click\">#Spare</a>” </p> <p>The prospects for reconciliation were remote even before the book, Mayer said, “but there is a strong incentive for King Charles to initiate some kind of truce – this is bringing back the fallout from his first marriage and questions about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/camilla-parker-bowles\">Queen Camilla </a>are resurfacing already.”</p> <p>Mayer notes that the alleged racism, bullying and image manipulation inside the institution are not being examined. Left alone, they have the power to dissolve faith in the idea of a hereditary head of state.</p> <p>“The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/17/irritating-yes-silly-yes-but-harry-and-meghan-are-right-on-one-thing-press-persecution\">extreme reaction</a>, and probably confected outrage, when Meghan mimicked a curtsey in the Netflix documentary is a case in point,” said Mayer. “In fact within the palace staff there is competition to see who can go lowest without falling over. So she was not being so disrespectful. She had a point.”</p> <p>Partly to blame, Mayer holds, are the “layers of secrecy and obfuscation” that surround the royal family and encourage misunderstandings. “It is intended as a defence, but it will defeat the organisation if they concentrate on the personalities. The whole family is meant to be an idealised reflection of the British people themselves and Harry’s marriage to Meghan made the job much easier,” she said. “The failure of that project is absolutely catastrophic for the royal family.”</p> <p>The emotional impact of the new book gains extra weight when Harry tells Bradby about his feeling of numbness following the sudden death of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997: “I cried once, at the burial, and you know I go into detail about how strange it was and how actually there was some guilt that I felt and I think William felt as well, by walking around the outside of Kensington Palace … Everyone thought and felt like they knew our mum, and the two closest people to her, the two most loved people by her, were unable to show any emotion in that moment.”</p>',\n     'wordcount': '705'},\n    'tags': [{'id': 'uk/monarchy',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Monarchy',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/monarchy',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/monarchy',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/prince-harry',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Prince Harry',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-harry',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/prince-harry',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/prince-william',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Prince William',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-william',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/prince-william',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/uk',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'UK news',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/prince-charles',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'King Charles III',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-charles',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/prince-charles',\n      'references': []}],\n    'isHosted': False,\n    'pillarId': 'pillar/news',\n    'pillarName': 'News'},\n   {'id': 'uk-news/2023/jan/07/prince-harry-spare-revelations-like-b-list-celebrity-dimbleby-william-diana',\n    'type': 'article',\n    'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n    'sectionName': 'UK news',\n    'webPublicationDate': '2023-01-07T13:25:58Z',\n    'webTitle': 'Prince Harry revelations ‘like those of B-list celebrity’',\n    'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/07/prince-harry-spare-revelations-like-b-list-celebrity-dimbleby-william-diana',\n    'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/jan/07/prince-harry-spare-revelations-like-b-list-celebrity-dimbleby-william-diana',\n    'fields': {'byline': 'Tobi Thomas',\n     'body': '<p>A former royal biographer has said he is “perplexed” by the Duke of Sussex’s memoirs and says it contains the kind of revelations you would expect from a “B-list celebrity”. </p> <p>Jonathan Dimbleby said Prince Harry had “constructed a narrative of his life which goes right back to the death of his mother”, as his highly anticipated book, Spare, is due to be released on Tuesday.</p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Dimbleby, who interviewed Charles when, as Prince of Wales, he revealed his relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles, said: “I am perplexed. I am at a loss. He is clearly a very troubled man.</p> <p>“I’m concerned incidentally that everyone uses the word revelations. Yes, there are obviously revelations about how he lost his virginity, taking drugs, and how many people he feels he might have shot down from his Apache. But those are the kind of revelations, in part, that you would expect, I suppose, from a B-list celebrity.”</p> <p>He added: “I think he has constructed a narrative of his life which goes right back to his sense of terrible loss … back to the death of his mother and the loss of his mother … which very easily becomes everything that happens to you since.”</p> <p>Asked how King Charles must feel about the book, Dimbleby said: “I can only imagine he is extremely pained, very frustrated and would be very anxious to bring it to an end.”</p> <p>But he said he would be surprised if Harry was not invited to the coronation because “that would simply fuel the flames”. </p> <p>In his memoir, Prince Harry claims that he was not the real best man at the wedding of his brother, the Prince of Wales.</p> <p>According to reports in the Mirror, Harry said the pretence was carried out on behalf of two of William’s close friends, James Meade and Thomas Van Straubenzee, in order for them to avoid a high level of scrutiny over their private lives.</p> <p>Writing in the highly anticipated memoir, which was accidentally released early in Spain, the duke describes his apparent role as best man as a “bare-faced lie”, adding that Meade and Straubenzee gave the traditional speech at the reception.</p> <p>According to the Mirror – one of many outlets to obtain a copy of the Spanish version and translate it – Harry writes: “Willy doesn’t want me giving a best man’s speech.”</p> <p>The duke also claims his brother was “wasted” on rum hours before his wedding to Catherine Middleton, and that he was drunk when he went out to greet people on the Mall in London before the ceremony.</p> <p>Harry said he could smell “the aftermath of last night’s rum” on his “tipsy” brother’s breath, and that he offered mints to William as he lowered the windows of their car, telling him, “You smell of alcohol”.</p> <p>Writing about his own wedding seven years later, Harry reportedly claims William ordered him to shave his beard as he could not stand the thought of his younger brother having a perk he was denied, as he was made to shave his beard for his wedding.</p> <p>“At one point he actually ordered me, as the heir speaking to the spare, to shave,” he writes.</p> <p>The book is due to be published on Tuesday, having been ghost-written by JR Moehringer and follows Harry and Meghan’s Netflix documentary, in which the duke said he was “terrified” when William screamed and shouted at him during a tense Sandringham summit in 2020.</p> <p>The memoir is being published four months after the death of Harry’s grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and the start of his father’s reign as king, and follows years of turmoil for the royal family amid the “Megxit” crisis, the Duke of Edinburgh’s death, accusations of racism in the Sussexes’ Oprah interview and the brothers’ long-running feud.</p> <p>The reports come after revelations from the memoir were publicised, including that Harry said he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/06/army-veterans-criticise-prince-harry-claim-killed-25-taliban-afghanistan\">killed 25 Taliban fighters</a> during his second tour of Afghanistan, and that he and his brother begged his father not to marry Camilla, the now queen consort.</p>',\n     'wordcount': '675'},\n    'tags': [{'id': 'uk/prince-harry',\n      'type':

Indefatigable columnists have drawn deeply on the well of indignant metaphor and adjective; a well that surely must be close to running dry given the surfeit of Sussex publicity that has bookended this Christmas.</p> \\n<p>“Watch out Windsors, bitter Harry’s heating up his tureen of spleen again,” read one headline, while others described him as trashing his family, or being engaged in a cynical money-making exercise with a story that had a “short shelf-life”.</p> \\n<p>From Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace there has been silence, in public at least, with sources clearly indicating no desire for tit-for-tat.</p> \\n<p>But, will the royal family go spare over the book Spare when it is published on Tuesday? The trailers for the two interviews, both of which are to be broadcast on Sunday, revisit similar themes to those aired in the six-part Netflix docuseries Harry &amp; Meghan, which was streamed last month. Family fractures, press intrusion, the charge of failing to protect the couple – apparently levelled at both the institution and the family.</p> \\n<p>The royal family’s mantra, according to Harry, is: “Never complain, never explain.” But he says in the CBS clip that is “just a motto” and that behind the scenes a lot of complaining does go on. He implies it manifests itself in “spoon-fed stories” to a compliant press.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \\n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e611ef25-cf7e-499d-86ee-fe05d5da3246\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4vn_sF5fh-0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<p>So far the contents of the “candid” memoir remain unleaked. One unnamed source, said to have knowledge of the book, told the Sunday Times: “Generally I think the book [will be ] worse for them than the royal family is expecting. Everything is laid bare. Charles comes out of it better than I had expected but it’s tough on William, in particular, and even Kate gets a bit of a broadside.”</p> \\n<p>It’s not that long ago that the palace PR machine pulled off something of a triumphant coup with the one-time “fab four” of William, Kate, Harry and Meghan briefly and smilingly reuniting for a Windsor walkabout in the immediate aftermath of the queen’s death. Perhaps Harry’s book will pull back the curtain on that, along with other narratives the public are fed daily about “the firm”.</p> \\n<p>If any of the royals do react publicly, the bookies’ money would be on the Prince of Wales. Harry has already alleged his brother screamed and shouted at him during the Sandringham meeting that sealed the Sussexes’ departure from the UK and the royal fold.</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/02/prince-harry-would-like-father-brother-back-itv\">Prince Harry: I would like my father and my brother back</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>It was William, baited by Harry and Meghan’s public suggestion that the royal family was racist, who could not stop himself from replying when questioned by a TV reporter, saying: “We are very much not a racist family.”</p> \\n<p>Perhaps what will cut William most deeply, though, is his brother’s monopolisation of the memory of their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. Harry has spoken many times about the lasting psychological impact of her premature death on him.</p> \\n<p>Unfettered by protocol, he has claimed her publicly, time and again, and there is every expectation this will form a significant part of the book. ITV, in promoting the interview, said Harry would speak about his personal relationships and “never-before-heard details” surrounding her death. But Diana left behind two young boys.</p> \\n<p>As for the king, sources regularly claim that the door is always open to Harry and Meghan. It would undoubtedly take a very profound rift for Charles not to invite his younger son to his coronation on 6 May, or for Harry to decline the invitation. Whether the publication of Spare could prove to be the catalyst for this – or for some form of reconciliation – will only be evident once it has hit the bookshelves.</p>',\n     'wordcount': '761'},\n

'<p>Border Force officials will on Friday join the wave of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/industrial-action\">industrial action</a> across Britain, starting the first of a series of strikes at airports, while Royal Mail workers strike again for two days before Christmas.</p> \\n<p>Passengers travelling into the UK have been warned to be prepared for longer queues at immigration in airports, while many letters and parcels will now go undelivered before Christmas, as staff take action over pay trailing behind inflation.</p> \\n<p>Heathrow, the biggest of the six airports where Border Force staff are to strike, said it expected the vast majority of journeys to be unaffected, with no flights cancelled before the industrial action.</p> \\n<p>About 1,000 members of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union will continue to strike over the remaining days of 2022, apart from 27 December.</p> \\n<p>The Home Office, which is responsible for Border Force, has drafted in officials from other departments as well as hundreds of members of the armed forces as a contingency workforce to try to mitigate the effects of the strikes.</p> \\n<p>The chief operating officer of Border Force, Steve Dann, has not ruled out airport closures in a worst-case scenario, and he said the travelling public <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/21/passengers-warned-to-expect-delays-during-uk-border-force-strike\">should expect disruption</a>.</p> \\n<p>Just under 9,000 flights are now scheduled to land at the six affected airports – Birmingham, Cardiff, Glasgow, Gatwick, Heathrow and Manchester – during the strikes, carrying up to 1.8 million passengers, according to data from the aviation analytics firm Cirium. Officials will also strike at one seaport, Newhaven in East Sussex.</p> \\n<p>The airports are confident that the contingency staff and e-gates, which will be unaffected, will process most passengers effectively during the strikes. The volume of passengers travelling through airports is still only about 85% of pre-pandemic levels.</p> \\n<p>Heathrow expects departing flights will see little or no impact, with all terminals open as normal, but warned that incoming travellers should be prepared for longer waits in the immigration hall, particularly if they do not have passports that can be used at the automatic gates.</p> \\n<p>Meanwhile, Royal Mail said it would do all it could to ensure delivery of last-minute Christmas cards and parcels, as tens of thousands of postal workers strike again in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/01/uk-strikes-fair-pay-job-security-unions-health-education-rail-royal-mail\">increasingly bitter dispute</a> with its staff in the Communications Workers Union.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \\n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2022/12/strike-calendar/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \\n  <div>\\n   default\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Royal Mail said the industrial action, which will have covered 18 days this year by Christmas, had now cost it £100m.</p> \\n<p>A spokesperson said: “Over the next 48 hours we will be doing all we can to deliver Christmas for our customers. Thousands of employees from across the business have swapped their regular day jobs to help sort and deliver the festive mailbag.

Judges dismissed an application from asylum seekers, aid groups and a border officials’ union to stop the Conservative government from sending people seeking to claim asylum in the UK to Rwanda.</p> <p>But in a rebuke for the Home Office, two judges said the government failed to consider the circumstances of eight individuals it tried to deport under the scheme in June.</p> <p>The partial victory for the government does not mean flights will be able to take off straight away. There are expected to be further appeals, and a European court of human rights <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/14/european-court-humam-right-makes-11th-hour-intervention-in-rwanda-asylum-seeker-plan\">injunction in the summer</a> prevented immediate deportations until the legal process has been exhausted. Lawyers and NGOs claimed that the legal process “could take years” rather than months.</p> <p>The ruling comes after Sunak prioritised the deterrence of people from seeking asylum in the UK. More than 44,000 people have arrived in Britain by crossing the Channel in small boats and several have died, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/14/channel-deaths-desperate-call-from-boat-raised-alarm-for-rescue-operation\">four last week</a> when a boat capsized in freezing weather.</p> <p>It is understood that some of the applicants, who include the Public and Commercial Services trade union and the charities Care4Calais and Detention Action, will appeal against the judgment.</p> <p>One of the judges, Lord Justice Lewis, said: “The court has concluded that it is lawful for the government to make arrangements for relocating asylum seekers to Rwanda and for their asylum claims to be determined in Rwanda rather than in the United Kingdom.”</p> <p>But he added that the government “must decide if there is anything about each person’s particular circumstances which means that his asylum claim should be determined in the United Kingdom or whether there are other reasons why he should not be relocated to Rwanda. The home secretary has not properly considered the circumstances of the eight individual claimants whose cases we have considered.”</p> <p>Under the deportation agreement, the UK would send some people who arrive in the UK as stowaways or in boats to Rwanda, where their asylum claims would be processed. Those granted asylum would stay in Rwanda rather than returning to the UK.</p> <p>Britain has paid Rwanda £140m under the deal struck in April, but no one has yet been sent there. The UK was forced to cancel the first deportation flight at the last minute in June after the European court of human rights ruled the plan carried “a real risk of irreversible harm”.</p> <p>Human rights groups say it is illegal, unworkable and inhumane to send people thousands of miles to a country they do not want to live in. They also cite Rwanda’s poor human rights record, including allegations of torture and killings of government opponents.</p> <p>It emerged in court that in March 2021 Foreign Office officials told Dominic Raab, then the foreign secretary, that if Rwanda was selected for the deportation policy, “we would need to be prepared to constrain UK positions on Rwanda’s human rights record, and to absorb resulting criticism from UK parliament and NGOs”.</p> <p>In another memo, Foreign Office officials said they had advised Downing Street against engagement with several countries, including Rwanda.</p> <p>The court also heard that the UK’s then high commissioner to Rwanda previously indicated that the east African country should not be used as an option for the policy, telling the government it “has been accused of recruiting refugees to conduct armed operations in neighbouring countries”.</p> <p>The challenge was backed by the UNHCR, which said Rwanda’s system for assessing refugees lacked the “minimum components of an accessible, reliable, fair and efficient asylum system”.</p> <p>The UK receives fewer asylum seekers than many European countries, including Germany, France and Italy. Some asylum seekers want to reach the UK because they have friends or family here, others because they speak English or because it is perceived to be easy to find work.</p> <p>The government wants to deport all people who arrive by unauthorised routes, and aims to strike Rwanda-style deals with other countries. Critics say there are few authorised routes for seeking asylum in the UK, other than those set up for people from Ukraine, Afghanistan and Hong Kong.</p> <p>Responding to Monday’s judgment, Clare Moseley, the founder of Care4Calais, said she was discussing “next steps” with her legal team. “We will consider our position in respect of the court of appeal,” she said.</p> <p>The PCS general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said: “We’re disappointed the court hasn’t found in our favour but we’re pleased that eight refugees have had their decisions quashed and will not be deported to Rwanda at this stage.”</p> <p>Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “If the government moves ahead with these harmful plans, it would damage the UK’s reputation as a country that values human rights, and undermine our commitment to provide safety to those fleeing conflict and oppression, as enshrined in the 1951 refugee convention.”</p> <p>The Rwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makolo said: “This is a positive step in our quest to contribute to innovative, long-term solutions to the global migration crisis.”</p> <p>Frank Habineza, the leader of Rwanda’s opposition Green party, said he opposed any deal involving migration. “We think countries such as the UK should not shift away from their obligation,” he said.</p> <p>Priti Patel, the former home secretary who devised the policy, welcomed the judgment. “No single policy will stop the Channel crossings, but this important policy will save lives,” she said.</p> <p>Labour and the Liberal Democrats urged the government to abandon “unworkable, unethical, extortionately expensive” Rwanda policy.</p> <p>Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dems’ home affair spokesperson, said: “The Conservatives are betraying the UK’s proud tradition of providing sanctuary to refugees fleeing war and persecution, and breaching our commitments under the 1951 UN refugee convention.”</p>',\n     'wordcount': '1089'},\n    'tags':

On Monday at 10.30am, at the Royal Courts of Justice, they will deliver their judgment.</p> <p>The government’s plan to export asylum seekers from one of the world’s richest countries to one of the world’s poorer nations, 4,000 miles away, is so radical that no other country has attempted anything like it.</p> <p>The government says it must introduce the Rwanda policy to deter asylum seekers from crossing the Channel in small boats. So far, £140m has been paid to Rwanda and not a single asylum seeker sent there.</p> <p>And it’s hard to find evidence of any deterrent effect. Record numbers have crossed the Channel this year, with an increase after the Rwanda <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/14/tens-of-thousands-of-asylum-seekers-could-be-sent-to-rwanda-says-boris-johnson\">announcement</a> on 14 April. More than 45,000 have crossed so far this year, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/migrants-detected-crossing-the-english-channel-in-small-boats\">including 350 people in seven boats</a> in freezing conditions on Saturday. In 2021, the total number of people who crossed was 28,526.</p> <p>Privilege Style, the commercial airline engaged by the Home Office to make the first Rwanda flight on 14 June which was grounded, has now said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/oct/21/airline-hired-uk-rwanda-deportations-pulls-out-privilege-style\">it will no longer be involved</a> in flying people to Rwanda. Although Sir James Eadie KC, representing the government, assured the court that the Rwanda scheme had specific <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/05/uk-accused-of-attempting-to-deport-children-to-rwanda\">safeguarding elements</a> built into it and “there has been the most intensive investigation of that scheme imaginable”, little emerged in the documents to give comfort to critics.</p> <p>What the documents show, beginning with a diplomatic telegram from the British high commissioner to Rwanda, dated 18 September 2020, are repeated concerns about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/16/foreign-office-official-criticisms-rwanda-plan-asylum-seekers\">unsuitability of Rwanda</a> as a destination country for asylum seekers. The high commissioner expressed alarm about a lack of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/rwanda-human-rights-fears-paul-kagame\">freedom of speech</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/07/margaret-atwood-joins-writers-calling-for-urgent-action-over-missing-rwandan-poet-innocent-bahati\">disappearance of opponents</a> of the country’s president, Paul Kagame.</p> <p>As the plans developed, the criticisms from government officials multiplied: extrajudicial killings; the recruitment of refugees to conduct armed operations in neighbouring countries, including children aged 15-17 to fight across Rwanda’s border in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo; a red traffic-light rating in relation to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/05/deported-uk-asylum-seekers-human-rights-at-risk-in-rwanda-court-told\">human rights</a>; and a clear recommendation made to the director general at the Home Office on 23 April 2021 not to pursue Rwanda as an option.</p> <p>The UN refugee agency UNHCR has been particularly vocal in its criticism of the Rwanda scheme. Disclosures show the agency’s opposition to offshore processing deals as “burden shifting rather than responsibility sharing” was well known by the government.</p> <p>A memorandum of understanding has been signed between UK and Rwanda but if either side breaches it no court can hold the parties to account because a MoU is less legally binding than a treaty.</p> <p>The two judges in the case, Lord Justice Lewis and Mr Justice Swift, have heard several separate cases about the Rwanda deal, including one from several asylum seekers – alongside the charities Care4Calais and Detention Action, and the PCS union – and another from the charity Asylum Aid.</p> <p>What is almost certain is that whoever is on the ‘losing side’ of tomorrow’s judgment will appeal. The judgment could trigger a series of appeals through all the domestic courts and on to the European court of human rights. The timescale and chances of the home secretary’s ‘dream’ of getting a Rwanda flight into the air remain unclear.</p> <h2> ‘If they send people to Rwanda, they will die’</h2> <p>Hayat (not his real name) an asylum seeker from Eritrea, lost both his parents when he was a child. He tried to find safety first in Ethiopia and then Sudan before managing to reach Russia in 2018 and then travelling on to Ukraine where he claimed asylum.</p> <p>But no decision had been made about his case when Russia invaded Ukraine in February so, unlike Ukrainian citizens who were eligible to apply for a visa to come to the UK, he fled to France and arrived in the UK using the dangerous small boat route.</p> <p>“They have accepted thousands of Ukrainian refugees – so what about us? We are from the same place, so why are we being treated differently?” he asked.</p> <p>Since arriving in the UK, he has received a notice of intent from the Home Office saying he is being considered for forced removal to Rwanda.</p> <p>“I am very scared every night about Rwanda. I can’t sleep. I have flashbacks about Ukraine and the war, And now I have Rwanda too. It is so bad that I am receiving medical help. “I am African, I come from that continent. I know about Rwanda and the problems that the country has had. If they send people to Rwanda, they will die. I will commit suicide if they try and put me on a plane.”</p> <p>Hayat is receiving support from refugee charity Care4Calais. He is supporting their campaign with trade union PCS to secure safe passage for refugees.</p> <p>Clare Moseley, Care4Calais founder, said: “Hayat has experienced unbelievable pain and danger but, because he originally came from Eritrea, our government did not allow him safe passage from Ukraine, despite his life being under threat from the war there. Now they want to forcibly deport him to Rwanda where we cannot guarantee his safety. No victim of war, torture or human rights abuses should be put though this trauma.

Some 29% were opposed, down one point.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/12/nurses-strikeschart/giv-6562To37Y5tnLw7d/\" data-alt=\"nurses strike\"> \\n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/12/nurses-strikeschart/giv-6562To37Y5tnLw7d/\">Interactive</a> \\n</figure> \\n<p>In another cause for concern in Downing St, there also appears to be public pressure for the government to reopen talks with nurses. Sunak and health secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/dec/12/steve-barclay-nurses-strikes-industrial-action-conservatives-uk-politics-latest?page=with:block-6396e4208f08a6133634b9b5\" title=\"\">Steve Barclay have insisted that reopening</a> talks would undermine the independent pay review body that recommended the pay settlement on the table from the government.</p> \\n<p>However, half of voters (50%) think the government should negotiate on pay, even if that means having to award more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/15/sunak-facing-growing-pressure-to-improve-nurses-pay-offer-strikes\" title=\"\">the pay review body recommended</a>. Only 23% think they should not negotiate with unions on pay and stick to those recommendations.</p> \\n<p>The findings expose the political difficulties Sunak faces as the government contemplates the chance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/dec/15/nurses-will-step-up-strikes-unless-pay-offer-improved-nhs-official-warns\" title=\"\">more strikes by nurses next month</a>. There is evidence that the public has a different view to striking nurses than to other sectors taking industrial action. For example, 45% oppose rail workers going on strike over the winter, while 39% support them.</p> \\n<p>Privately, senior figures in Downing St acknowledge the differences in public sentiment between nurses and other striking sectors. However, there is also serious nervousness about the precedent that would be set by in effect overriding an independent pay recommendation. Sunak continues to stick to the argument that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jul/20/nhs-england-staff-could-be-offered-3-percent-pay-rise\" title=\"\">nurses were offered a 3% pay rise last year </a>when other public-sector workers had a pay freeze – and are now being offered an increase of 4% to 5%.</p> \\n<p>Sunak has also been attempting to use the wave of winter strikes as a political tool to damage Labour, repeatedly using prime minister’s questions to attack Keir Starmer as being too weak to “stand up to the unions”. Yet there is now a clear split developing among his MPs over the need to give ground to nurses.</p> \\n<p>Some prominent MPs are coalescing around the idea that the pay review process could be reopened to take into account the high level of inflation in recent months. The idea was raised by Jerry Cope, a former head of the review body, who said revisiting its original finding may be a solution for an “apparently intractable problem”. Steve Brine, a former health minister who now chairs the Commons health select committee, has said that allowing the pay review body to look again at its recommendation would be a “sensible answer”.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \\n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"15213d07-abbf-4ad1-bc6c-38c5ef14a608\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CXgknf09440?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<p>However, others involved believe that there is no time for such a review and say that a more realistic moment for the government to compromise is at a meeting early in the new year to discuss next year’s pay settlement. At that moment, they believe ministers, the pay review body and trade unions could agree to a retrospective deal for the past year.</p> \\n<p>There is growing nervousness on the Tory benches over the government’s firm line against any increase in the offer for nurses. Former Tory chairman Jake Berry and former cabinet minister Robert Buckland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/dec/15/former-tory-ministers-join-calls-for-sunak-to-negotiate-with-nurses\" title=\"\">have called for a compromise</a>. There are also concerns that “red wall” voters are sympathetic to striking nurses.</p> \\n<p>Dan Poulter, a doctor and former health minister, said that it was “disingenuous” for ministers to hide behind the pay body as recommendations had been ignored in the past. He said there was no time for another independent review, instead calling for a compromise in the new year. He warned that the widespread use of temporary staff and a vacancies crisis showed that nurses’ pay has simply fallen too low.</p> \\n<p>“If we go back about 10 years, there would have only been a handful of hospitals spending about 10% of their total staff bill on temporary and locum staff,” he said. “Now, 10% would be a very low figure for most hospital trusts, with most trusts spending 20-25% of their staffing bill on temporary staff. That is not sustainable and it’s not an acceptable place to be.</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/17/nhs-strikes-england-wales-northern-ireland\">How will the NHS strikes affect you?</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>“I would suggest that some of my colleagues will have postbags filling up with messages from constituents, urging a rapid resolution to this crisis. People will also be concerned about what the impact of this is going to be on their own care or the care of their friends and family. That’s a very real issue for a lot of people.”</p> \\n<p>Other senior Tories are warning that handing more to nurses will make it extremely hard for ministers to hold back other pay demands. “If they were going to do it, then resurrecting the pay review body is possible,” they said. “But if they did that, they’d have to put a huge amount of political effort into saying this is just nurses, because they have a special claim – and because strikes would undoubtedly lead to a large number of avoidable deaths. You could just about do that. But it will require statements from the prime minister. I wouldn’t recommend it at this stage.”</p> \\n<p>On Friday, Sunak showed no sign of moving towards a compromise deal, insisting that the deal on the table was “appropriate and fair”.</p>',\n

household</a> after repeatedly asking the black charity founder Ngozi Fulani where she was from during a charity palace reception has apologised to her in person, Buckingham Palace has said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/30/who-is-royal-aide-lady-susan-hussey\">Susan Hussey</a>, godmother to the Prince of Wales, met Fulani, the founder of Sistah Space, at the palace in a meeting described as “warm and understanding”, during which she apologised for comments including for asking “where she was really from” despite being told by Fulani she was British.</p> <p>Buckingham Palace had criticised the remarks as “unacceptable and deeply regrettable” and Lady Hussey, who had been recently made a lady of the household following the Queen’s death, stepped down immediately.</p> <p>A joint statement on behalf of Buckingham Palace and Fulani said the meeting to address the incident took place on Friday morning.</p> <p>The statement said: “At this meeting, filled with warmth and understanding, Lady Susan offered her sincere apologies for the comments that were made and the distress they caused to Ms Fulani. Lady Susan has pledged to deepen her awareness of the sensitivities involved and is grateful for the opportunity to learn more about the issues in this area.</p> <p>“Ms Fulani, who has unfairly received the most appalling torrent of abuse on social media and elsewhere, has accepted this apology and appreciates that no malice was intended.</p> <p>“The royal households will continue their focus on inclusion and diversity, with an enhanced programme of work which will extend knowledge and training programmes, examining what can be learnt from Sistah Space, and ensuring these reach all members of their communities.</p> <p>“Both Ms Fulani and Lady Susan ask now that they be left in peace to rebuild their lives in the wake of an immensely distressing period for them both. They hope that their example shows a path to resolution can be found with kindness, cooperation and the condemnation of discrimination wherever it takes root.</p> <p>“It is the wish of both parties that, at the end of the UN’s 16 days of activism against gender-based violence, attention can now return to the important work of Sistah Space in supporting women affected by domestic abuse.</p> <p>“Their majesties the king and the queen consort and other members of the royal family have been kept fully informed and are pleased that both parties have reached this welcome outcome.”</p> <p>Fulani claimed that during the reception, Hussey moved her hair to reveal her name badge and persistently questioned her over where her “people” came from, despite having been told she was a British national.</p> <p>She said she felt traumatised by the incident, which she described as an example of “institutional racism”.</p> <p>After the incident became headline news, Fulani <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/05/black-charity-boss-ngozi-fulani-tells-of-horrific-abuse-after-susan-hussey-palace-racism-incident\">said she had received “horrific abuse”</a>. In a statement at the time, she said: “My team, family and I have been put under immense pressure and received some horrific abuse via social media. Yet throughout this time I have been heartened by the huge amount of support we have received.”</p> <p>Hussey, the widow of the former BBC chair Sir Marmaduke Hussey, is a close friend of the king. Her daughter, Katherine Brooke, has just been appointed as one of Camilla’s new queen’s companions.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian after the incident, she said the first “no no” was Hussey moving her hair. “Here I am in this place as part of the 16 days of activism, experiencing non-physical violence – you feel like you have the right to approach me, put your hand in my hair and insist I don’t have the right to British nationality. In a space like that, what do you do?” She said she had “never felt so unwelcome or so uncomfortable”.</p> <p>But she had not wanted Hussey’s resignation, she said at the time. “I would have preferred that she had been spoken to or re-educated.”</p>',\n     'wordcount': '643'},\n    'tags': [{'id': 'uk/monarchy',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Monarchy',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/monarchy',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/monarchy',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'society/aristocracy',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'society',\n      'sectionName': 'Society',\n      'webTitle': 'Aristocracy',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/aristocracy',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/society/aristocracy',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'world/race',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'world',\n      'sectionName': 'World news',\n      'webTitle': 'Race',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/race',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/race',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/uk',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'UK news',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'society/charities',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'society',\n      'sectionName': 'Society',\n      'webTitle': 'Charities',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/charities',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/society/charities',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'society/society',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'society',\n      'sectionName': 'Society',\n      'webTitle': 'Society',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/society',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/society/society',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'society/voluntarysector',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'society',\n      'sectionName': 'Society',\n      'webTitle': 'Voluntary sector',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/voluntarysector',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/society/voluntarysector',\n      'references': []}],\n    'isHosted': False,\n    'pillarId': 'pillar/news',\n    'pillarName': 'News'},\n   {'id': 'uk-news/2022/dec/16/digested-week-give-me-the-white-lotus-over-harry-and-meghan-any-day',\n    'type': 'article',\n    'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n    'sectionName': 'UK news',\n    'webPublicationDate': '2022-12-16T11:20:44Z',\n    'webTitle': 'Digested week: give me The White Lotus over Harry and Meghan any day | John Crace',\n    'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/16/digested-week-give-me-the-white-lotus-over-harry-and-meghan-any-day',\n    'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/dec/16/digested-week-give-me-the-white-lotus-over-harry-and-meghan-any-day',\n    'fields': {'byline': 'John Crace',\n     'body': '<h2>Monday</h2> <p>An old friend died recently. The cause of death has not been made public, but he is believed to have killed himself. The news came as a profound shock. Though I knew he had had mental health problems, I thought he was largely out the other side and had found a way of living with them. Our relationship was unusual. We rarely – if ever – socialised together, but knew each other intimately. We were in the same psychotherapy group for many years. I’m still going. He was a lovely man. Generous, warm, kind and very, very funny. And damaged. Though you can take that as read. My heart goes out to his wife and children. When I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/27/i-was-a-heroin-addict-and-had-given-up-on-myself-then-suddenly-briefly-i-felt-a-desire-to-live\">was in rehab</a> more than 35 years ago, one of the counsellors told us that, statistically speaking, half of us would be dead within 15 years or so. At the time I just thought she was trying to shock us into changing our behaviour, but it turned out she was telling no more than the truth. Half of us were dead well within the time frame. Since then the death rate among those people I knew who were addicts has at times felt attritional. Quite apart from the usual suspects of relapse, overdose, Aids and suicide, the incidence of death through cancer and heart disease have been far higher among the addicts I know than other people. It might just be a coincidence but I suspect not. My dad, towards the end of his life, used to say that old age wasn’t for wimps. I’m beginning to know how he felt. The number of people who used to know me as a young man are getting fewer and fewer. It’s starting to get lonely.</p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>The trailer for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/15/harry-meghan-volume-2-netflix-review-a-remarkable-reminder-of-how-petty-the-royals-can-be\">second half of the Harry and Meghan Netflix series</a> appeared in my Twitter feed. It promised more “explosive” revelations, with Meghan saying she hadn’t been thrown to the wolves, she had been fed to them, and Harry saying that an unidentified they – could be the palace, could be the media – had lied to protect his brother and had failed to tell the truth to protect him. Having not bothered to watch the first part last week, I thought I would go back and give it a go to see what all the fuss was about, if nothing else. I lasted two episodes before bailing out. Turns out that either I’m not sufficiently attuned to the nuances of royal psychodramas (though I loved The Crown) or I’m just not that interested. I don’t find it surprising that some members of the royal family may be a bit racist and are emotionally shut off, and I just felt I was hearing Harry and Meghan say the same things they had been saying for years. There was nothing new in it. It was also a bum note to start the series with Harry complaining how hard done by he was with footage of him in the Windsor VIP suite at Heathrow. Tin-eared or what? It also seems an odd way of going about things to trouser £20m to make a series about how you hate the media, when the best way to get the media off your back would be to lie low. I’d be more inclined to listen to the couple – did you really not realise that the fifth in line to the throne gets treated differently to the heir? – if they stopped taking money from his dad, got proper jobs (Meghan could make a decent living as an actor: Harry could become a surf instructor at Malibu) and abandoned their royal titles. Harry could even take Meghan’s surname. For properly class TV, I will stick with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/12/the-white-lotus-finale-review-an-absolute-televisual-chefs-kiss\">The White Lotus</a>. Series two even better than series one. It deserves to win every prize going.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>One weekend in September, I got caught speeding on the way up to north London to have lunch with a friend. I was doing 24 mph in a 20 mph zone and felt I was driving safely. But the cameras don’t lie – at least I assume they don’t – and a month or so later I got a letter informing me of the offence. I was also given the opportunity to go on a speed awareness course, which I quickly accepted as I didn’t want the fine, the three points and higher insurance premium. This week I finally did the course online. I had no great expectations of it, thinking it was likely to be punitive and shaming, but was something to be endured. Instead it was highly informative, non-judgmental and thoroughly worthwhile. Almost enjoyable. Hats off to whoever designed the course. Right away my assumptions were shattered. I had always rather reckoned that going a few miles per hour over the speed limit in a 20 mph zone would make little difference to my ability to stop as I was already driving slowly. Wrong. Just 1 mph adds several metres to braking distance. Enough to hit a pedestrian stepping out into the road. I also realised that I had no idea how some of the controls on the car operated. The car says it has a cruise control but I haven’t worked out how to set it. Something for the weekend. I’d also like to make the radio work properly: I used to be able to get hundreds of digital stations and can now only get a handful. Most of which I don’t want. It’s anyone’s guess where the others have got to. Sorry to sound like a zealot, but I’m a recent convert. That annoying person driving at 20 when the road ahead is clear? That’s me.</p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>I’ve let myself down. I’ve fallen for the Qatari dollars. I had been determined I wouldn’t get too caught up in this year’s World Cup. It was too corrupt; riddled with human rights abuses. I wouldn’t watch many games. And I certainly wouldn’t start a Panini sticker album for the first time since 1970. I did at least stick to that. The rest not so much. It was the lobby league, run by the i’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/paul-waugh\">Paul Waugh</a>, that sucked me in. The brilliant competition where everyone in Westminster has 10 teams – four favourite, four intermediates, two outsiders – ranked in order and you get awarded points for how well they perform. The higher you’ve ranked a team, the more points you get. It’s addictive stuff. I took my choices more seriously this year. I didn’t pick England as I thought they would get knocked out in the quarter-finals. I got that right, but came unstuck with Portugal, Spain and Belgium. I’m currently in about 170th place out of 250. The Guardian’s fabulous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jessica-elgot\">Jess Elgot</a> is second. But with the semi-finals played – I’m for France in the final – I’ve just about had enough. I can’t face another shabby ITV commentary. The “little genius” Messi. The plucky Croats. Agh. It’s time to return to proper football. Starting with Brentford v Spurs on Boxing Day.</p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>Tomorrow is the Guardian’s <a href=\"https://guardian.ctdonate.org/?utm_source=gdnwb&amp;utm_medium=editorial&amp;utm_campaign=CharityAppeal2022EditorialArticles&amp;CMP_TU=editorial&amp;CMP_BUNIT=edtrl\">annual charity</a> telethon. I will be taking calls between 10am and noon, so please do ring in. After that I will be off to what was meant to be a surprise lunch in honour of Terry Blake, the co-founder and captain of what was described in Wisden – I should know, I wrote it – as the country’s worst cricket team. But Terry has an unerring knack of rooting out secrets and has spent the last two months trying to organise his own surprise by proxy. So take a bow, Terry. And take a bow the Hemingford Hermits, 1977 to the present day. Many is the afternoon I’ve watched Terry decide he is the ideal man to open the innings and score a careful 20 at less than a run an over, leaving the middle order to try to rustle up a non-competitive total in the remaining 12 overs. It was my pleasure to be a member of the Hermits from the mid-1980s until 2010, when I had an artificial knee fitted and could run even slower than Terry. My retirement went entirely unnoticed and unremarked on by everyone. Even me. Most people stop playing when they notice an unacceptable fall in performance. I had no such decline as I was always hopeless. Despite many threats and entreaties, Terry never put me higher in the order than nine – I generally only got to bat when there were four balls left and was instructed to slog – and considered me his fifth change bowler. Other more useless players who may have been in a position to help Terry in his career were allowed to bat where they liked. The Hermits were and are his fiefdom. And for reasons I still can’t explain, those summer days spent being ignored were some of the happiest days of my life. I came to realise my role in the team was to sledge my own team. What’s not to like? Terry. O captain, my captain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30d226cbc1cdf2d920e9d2b12901a42b132f3649\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30d226cbc1cdf2d920e9d2b12901a42b132f3649/0_326_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Suella Braverman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I’m dreaming of a Rwandan Christmas.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>    <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fb48c813457381a60388075144aea9755d6eaa5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fb48c813457381a60388075144aea9755d6eaa5/0_108_4918_2951/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boys in top hats \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Where’s Rees-Moggins?’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geoff Robinson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"https://mailto:jo@samaritans.ie/\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

She regarded their wedding and Meghan’s initial acceptance into the family as a step in the right direction for the institution.</p> <p>“That’s what I thought initially. Then it went all downhill very quickly,” said Griffiths. “I think [the documentary] further compounded what I suspected all along – that this family that lives off the public purse is not reflective of society.”</p> <p>Griffiths is not alone. The turbulent years that followed the wedding, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/15/prince-william-bullied-sussexes-royal-duties-harry-meghan\">latest revelations in the Netflix Harry &amp; Meghan documentary</a>, has either worsened or reinforced critical views of the royal family among other black women, and has them questioning whether the institution can be reformed at all.</p> <p>Griffiths, who was a teenager when she witnessed the Brixton riots in 1981 and has campaigned against racism for decades, described Meghan’s treatment by the royal family as the opening of Pandora’s box: “I just think that if they’re going to live off the public purse, they’ll have to be doing more than just going to a few events and shaking hands. We really need to question the relevance of the monarchy in today’s society. We need to have the grown up conversation about race and their role.”</p> <p>Natasha Mulenga, a 32-year-old writer and host of the podcast A Soulful Storm, said: “It’s changed my opinion more towards the negative. So much information has come out that really has made me doubt whether the institution can be reformed.”</p> <p>She also pointed to the recent incident involving Ngozi Fulani, the black charity boss who said she was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/10/safety-fears-force-ngozi-fulanis-charity-sistah-space-to-pause-work-after-palace-racism-case\">repeatedly questioned about her background by the late queen’s former lady-in-waiting</a>. “The experience that she had inside Buckingham Palace, it just seems that there’s a determination to basically stay in the 1940s,” Mulenga said.</p> <p>She did not believe that the palace’s alleged racist incidents were down to ignorance alone, she said. “Where ignorance happens, there is a chance for learning and change, and it doesn’t seem like that has happened. If anything, it seems like it’s got worse.</p> <p>“I think that there’s something very telling about the fact that they use the bi-racial woman as a scapegoat that can be used for slander, for insidious stories, and giving her no real support; no chance to help even when someone makes her aware that this isn’t just harassment she’s receiving, there’s racial aspects to it as well.</p> <p>“And then when you find out that there is a mental health element and you still don’t want to help, it makes me wonder: where is not only the moral compass, but just even the sense of care as a human being.”</p> <p>Kaia Allen-Bevan, a 20-year-old poet, said she believed Meghan’s experience would resonate deeply with black women around the world. “When I watch this documentary, I see me in some way, shape or form, from the feeling of being an ‘outsider’ to being failed by an institution.”</p> <p>She said Meghan’s revelation that she had had suicidal thoughts forced her to think of the traumatising, and at times, deadly impact of racism in the UK.</p> <p>“When we do demand justice, we are met with deliberate misreporting, denial and invalidation of our pain,” Allen-Bevan said. “She could have been another life taken due to the failings of our systems and its people. Meghan’s entry to the royal family was an opportunity to do better, and this has only shown us that not just the royal family, but institutions and individuals across the UK, have been unsupported, to say the least, and that racism is still rife in our country.”</p> <p>Kimberly McIntosh, the author of the upcoming book Black Girl, No Magic, admits that though she is a staunch republican, she was interested in Harry and Meghan’s story. “I didn’t think it was going to reform the family and bring about social change, but I did follow the story and I was kind of rooting for them in a way that surprised me.”</p> <p>She sent her friends web links about the wedding, including the song choices used, and found herself reading about the couple, but the documentary, and the last few years, had compounded her belief that the royal family cannot become egalitarian, she said. “Ultimately, the premise is you have to be born into the family in order to be part of it, or marry into it, and there is no other meritocratic way to enter it. And so an institution that is built on that premise can never be modernised.”</p> <p>She added: “Without an acknowledgment of the way the royal family came today, and kind of the oppressive systems that they have been part of – whether that’s their role with enslavement or the British empire – I just think it’s impossible to reform them.</p> <p>“If we want to say that it’s important to us that we try to tackle racism and that is a feature of a modern and progressive society, then I think that that is the antithesis of the royal family as it stands.”</p>',\n     'wordcount': '853'},\n    'tags': [{'id': 'uk/monarchy',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Monarchy',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/monarchy',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/monarchy',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk-news/meghan-duchess-of-sussex',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/meghan-duchess-of-sussex',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/meghan-duchess-of-sussex',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/prince-harry',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Prince Harry',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-harry',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/prince-harry',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/uk',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'UK news',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'world/race',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'world',\n      'sectionName': 'World news',\n      'webTitle': 'Race',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/race',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/race',\n      'references': []}],\n    'isHosted': False,\n    'pillarId': 'pillar/news',\n    'pillarName': 'News'},\n   {'id': 'uk-news/2022/dec/15/prince-william-bullied-sussexes-royal-duties-harry-meghan',\n    'type': 'article',\n    'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n    'sectionName': 'UK news',\n    'webPublicationDate': '2022-12-15T16:45:01Z',\n    'webTitle': 'Stress of legal action against Mail on Sunday caused Meghan’s miscarriage, Harry claims',\n    'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/15/prince-william-bullied-sussexes-royal-duties-harry-meghan',\n    'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/dec/15/prince-william-bullied-sussexes-royal-duties-harry-meghan',\n    'fields': {'byline': 'Caroline Davies',\n     'body': '<p>The Duke of Sussex has claimed the stress of the Duchess of Sussex’s privacy action against the Mail on Sunday caused her to miscarry.</p> <p>The prince also revealed his brother screamed and shouted at him during the fraught Sandringham summit that led to the couple quitting the UK and royal duties.</p> <p>The prince claimed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/14/royal-households-accused-planting-coverage-meghan\">palace wars</a> had left him heartbroken, suggesting Prince William’s office deliberately briefed against him and Meghan, despite a promise the brothers had made not to copy the same tactics allegedly used by Charles’s office.</p> <p>In the final three episodes of the Netflix documentary Harry &amp; Meghan, Harry said of Meghan’s successful legal action against the Mail on Sunday and Mail Online over publication of parts of her private letter to her estranged father, Thomas Markle.</p> <p>“I believe my wife suffered a miscarriage because of what the Mail did. I watched the whole thing. Now, do we absolutely know that the miscarriage was caused by that – course we don’t,” he said.</p> <p>“But bearing in mind the stress that caused, the lack of sleep and the timing of the pregnancy – how many weeks in she was – I can say from what I saw, that miscarriage was created by what they were trying to do to her.”</p> <p>Speaking of the bitterness caused throughout the process of the couple’s departure as working royals, Harry said: “I mean, the saddest part of it was this wedge created between me and my brother so that he’s now on the institution’s side – and I get, part of that I get. I understand, right? That’s his inheritance, so to some extent it’s already ingrained in him that part of his responsibility is the survivability and the continuation of this institution.”</p> <p>In private video footage, Harry is seen sharing a text with Meghan from William, shown immediately after footage in which William denied the royal family were racist after the Oprah Winfrey interview. Meghan reacted with “wow” as she looked at the screen, then hugged Harry, as he said “I wish I knew what to do”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/15/harry-meghan-volume-2-netflix-review-a-remarkable-reminder-of-how-petty-the-royals-can-be\">Harry &amp; Meghan Volume 2 review – a remarkable reminder of how petty the royals can be</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In other revelations, Harry claimed a joint statement was put out without his permission in his and William’s name on the day of the summit denying a story that William had bullied him out of the royal family.</p> <p>“No one had asked me permission to put my name to a statement like that.

And that was the scariest thing about it. It was such clear thinking.”</p> <p>Harry said he was “devastated” and felt “angry and ashamed” things got to that stage saying: “I dealt with it as an institutional Harry as opposed to husband Harry,” which he now hated himself for. </p> <p>Meghan said she “wanted to go somewhere to get help, but I wasn’t allowed to. They were concerned about how that would look for the institution”. </p> <p>As footage of newspaper headlines about Kate and Meghan flashed on screen, including pictures of the two women touching their baby bumps when pregnant, Harry contrasted the coverage. “If you don’t see the difference and understand why it’s being reported in that way, or why, then I can’t help you, I’m sorry, I just can’t.”</p> <p>Problems between the palaces had begun when Meghan began receiving more coverage than other royals, the couple claimed.</p> <p>“The issue is when someone who is marrying in and should be a supporting act is then stealing the limelight, or doing the job better than the person who was born to do this. That upsets people. It shifts the balance,” said Harry.</p> <p>As coverage of Meghan then became increasingly negative, Harry said: “No one would have private conversations with the editors saying ‘Enough’”. He said he spoke to Charles. “My dad said to me: ‘Darling boy, you can’t take on the media. The media will always be the media.’ I said: ‘I fundamentally disagree.’”</p> <p>He denied “blindsiding” the Queen over announcing the couple’s plans to move to Canada, and accused “the institution” leaking a letter about their plans to the press.</p> <p>He also claimed the couple were at Tyler Perry’s house in California in 2020 for six weeks before anyone knew, adding: “My family still thought I was in Canada.”</p>',\n     'wordcount': '1027'},\n    'tags': [{'id': 'uk/prince-harry',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle':

<p>The couple claimed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/15/prince-william-bullied-sussexes-royal-duties-harry-meghan\">acrimonious Sandringham summit</a>, where senior royals thrashed out details of the couple’s departure as working royals, was deliberately timed to exclude the duchess, who had flown back to Canada to be with their son, Archie. “Imagine a conversation, a roundtable discussion about the future of your life, when the stakes are this high, and you as the mom, and the wife – and the target in many regards – aren’t invited to have a seat at the table,” Meghan said. Harry added: “It was clear to me that they planned that so you weren’t in the room.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/08/harry-meghan-other-documentary-highlights-netflix\">How Harry met Meghan – and four more themes from the documentary so far</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Frosty relations</h2> <p>Of the couple’s final engagement as working royals at the Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey, Harry said: “I felt very distant from the rest of my family, which was interesting, because so much of how they operate is about what it looks like, rather than what it feels like. And it looked cold, but it also felt cold.” Returning later for the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral was hard, he said, “especially spending time having chats with my brother and my father who just were very much focused on the same misinterpretation of the whole situation”. He added: “I’ve had to make peace with the fact that I’m probably never going to get genuine accountability or a genuine apology.”</p> <h2>Death threats</h2> <p>Meghan cried as she said negative press coverage had led to online death threats, including one tweet that said: “Megan just needs to die, someone needs to kill her, maybe it should be me.” She said: “I was just, like, OK, that’s like what’s actually out in the world? It’s not just a tabloid. It’s not just some story. You are making me scared, right? And like, that night, to be up and down in the middle of the night, looking down the hallway, like: ‘Are we safe, are our doors locked? Is security on?’ – that’s real. ‘Are my babies safe?’<br>And you’ve created it for what? Because you’re bored, or because it sells your papers, or because it makes you feel better about your own life. It’s real, what you’re doing. And that’s because I don’t think people fully understand.”</p> <h2>Queen too busy</h2> <p>Harry claimed the Queen invited them to tea and to stay the night during a brief visit to the UK in 2020, saying she had no plans all week. But once they landed, aides told him she was busy. “Once we were back in the UK, I rang her and said: ‘We’re now told that you’re busy.’ And she said: ‘Yes. I didn’t know that I was busy. I’ve now been told I’m busy all week. I’ve actually been told I’m busy all week.’ I was, like: ‘Wow’.” Meghan said: “I remember looking at H and thinking: ‘My gosh. This is when a family and a family business are in direct conflict because they’re blocking you from seeing the queen, but what they’re really doing is blocking a grandson from seeing his grandmother.”</p> <h2>Stealing the limelight</h2> <p>“The issue is, when someone marrying in should be a supporting act, is then stealing the limelight or doing the job better than the person who is born to do this, that upsets people,” Harry said. “But the media are the ones who choose who to put on the front page. The first time that the penny dropped for her, M and I spent the night in a room at Buckingham Palace after an event where every member of the family, senior members of the family, had been, including the queen. And on the front page of the Telegraph: Meghan. She was like: ‘But it’s not my fault’. And my mum felt the same way.”</p> <h2>Harry’s decision</h2> <p>Harry said it was his decision to step back as a working royal, not his wife’s. “I’ve seen little cartoons of me on all fours and her holding a dog lead, and me wearing the dog collar. How predictable that you know the woman is to be blamed for the decision of a couple. In fact, it was my decision. She never asked to leave. I was the one that had to see it for myself. But it’s misogyny at its best.”</p> <p>Meghan said of people blaming her: “He wouldn’t have ever been attracted to me if he wasn’t already on his own path.”</p> <h2>Bullying allegation</h2> <p>James Holt, the executive director of Harry and Meghan’s Archewell Foundation, said the timing of allegations that Meghan had bullied staff “has even been admitted by the journalist that wrote it that it was done explicitly because of the Oprah interview”.</p> <p>Harry added: “I can’t think what my mum went through all those years ago by herself. To see this institutional gaslighting that happens … it’s extraordinary.</p> <p>“And that’s why everything that’s happened to us was always going to happen to us. Because if you speak truth to power, that’s how they respond.”</p> <h2>Grateful crew</h2> <p>Flying back to Canada after their final duties as working royals, Meghan said the head of the crew spoke to her after she boarded: “He came and knelt next to my seat and he took his hat off and I just remember looking at him and he goes: ‘We appreciate everything you did for our country.’ And it was the first time I felt like someone saw the sacrifice, not for my own country; for this country that’s not mine.”</p>',\n     'wordcount': '901'},\n    'tags': [{'id': 'uk/prince-harry',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Prince Harry',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-harry',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/prince-harry',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk-news/meghan-duchess-of-sussex',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/meghan-duchess-of-sussex',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/meghan-duchess-of-sussex',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/monarchy',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Monarchy',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/monarchy',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/monarchy',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/prince-william',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Prince William',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-william',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/prince-william',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/prince-charles',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'King Charles III',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-charles',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/prince-charles',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/queen',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Queen Elizabeth II',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/queen',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/queen',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/uk',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'UK news',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk',\n      'references': []}],\n    'isHosted': False,\n    'pillarId': 'pillar/news',\n    'pillarName': 'News'},\n   {'id': 'uk-news/2022/dec/14/royal-households-accused-planting-coverage-meghan',\n    'type': 'article',\n    'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n    'sectionName': 'UK news',\n    'webPublicationDate': '2022-12-14T16:41:56Z',\n    'webTitle': 'Royal households accused of ‘war against Meghan’ to protect palace',\n    'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/14/royal-households-accused-planting-coverage-meghan',\n    'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/dec/14/royal-households-accused-planting-coverage-meghan',\n    'fields': {'byline': 'Caroline Davies',\n     'body': '<p>The royal households have been directly accused of deliberately planting negative stories about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to deflect attention from less favourable coverage of other royals as part of what a lawyer calls “a war against Meghan”.</p> <p>In the latest trailer for the Sussexes’ <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/dec/14/harry-and-meghan-becomes-netflixs-biggest-documentary-debut-yet#:~:text=Harry%20%26%20Meghan%2C%20Netflix%27s%20documentary%20series,the%20company%20said%20on%20Tuesday.\">controversial Netflix documentary,</a> the duchess’s lawyer, Jenny Afia, claims to have seen evidence of briefing from the palace against the couple.</p> <p>Meghan appears in the teaser, before the release of the final three episodes on Thursday, saying: “You would just see it play out, like a story about someone in the family would pop up for a minute, and they’d go, ‘We’ve got to make that go away’.</p> <p>“But there’s real estate on a website homepage, there is real estate there on a newspaper front cover, and something has to be filled in there about someone royal,” she said.</p> <p>Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace declined to comment.</p> <p>As footage of Buckingham Palace is shown, Afia, of Schillings, says: “There was a real kind of war against Meghan and I’ve certainly seen evidence that there was negative briefing from the palace against Harry and Meghan to suit other people’s agendas.”</p> <p>The duchess’s friend Lucy Fraser adds: “Meg became this scapegoat for the palace. And so they would feed stories on her whether they were true or not to avoid other less favourable stories being printed.”</p> <p>Afia says: “This barrage of negative articles about the breakdown of the relationship with her father was the final straw in a campaign of negative, nasty coverage about her.”</p> <p>Volume II of Harry &amp; Meghan, comprising the final three episodes of the docuseries, will stream on Netflix on Thursday.</p> <p>As Meghan spoke, footage was played of newspaper front pages with the headlines “Meghan made Kate cry” and “Heir heads” – about Kate and Meghan’s flower dress dispute and the Sussexes’ use of private planes – along with others saying “Meghan: I won’t parade with baby” and “Celeb BB royal ‘race’ row”.</p> <p>In her Oprah Winfrey interview, Meghan said Kate, now the Princess of Wales, made her cry before her wedding at a flower girl dress fitting – not the other way round, as had been reported. She added that the false reports were a turning point, and “everyone in the institution knew that wasn’t true” but it was not corrected.</p> <p>In a previous trailer, Harry makes the intriguing claim: “They were happy to lie to protect my brother,” before adding: “They were never willing to tell the truth to protect us.”</p> <p>The identity of the “they” to which Harry is referring in his claims about Prince William is not immediately clear, though speculation will be that his comments relate to senior members of the royal family and their aides.</p> <p>Harry also says “to see this institutional gaslighting” as footage is shown of newspaper presses rolling. Meghan tells the camera: “I wasn’t being thrown to the wolves. I was being fed to the wolves.”</p> <p>In the episodes broadcast last week, the couple accused the media of “destroying” them before they left the UK, and said the royal family failed to understand that Harry’s future bride required protection.</p> <p>While Harry did accuse his family of unconscious racial bias, and failure to protect Meghan from racially charged reporting, the couple have so far focused on the early days of their relationship and directed their ire at the media.</p> <p>Details of the drama within the royal family surrounding the couple’s departure from the UK are expected to be aired in Thursday’s episodes. In one clip, Meghan says on camera: “This is when a family and a family business are in direct conflict.”</p>',\n     'wordcount': '606'},\n    'tags': [{'id': 'uk/prince-harry',\n      'type':

editor',\n     'body': '<p>Rishi Sunak has rejected calls by dozens of Conservative MPs to toughen up his asylum plans further by ignoring rulings from the European court of human rights over the deportation of asylum seekers to Rwanda.</p> \\n<p>The prime minister sidestepped questions in the Commons over whether he would be willing to withdraw from the European convention on human rights, saying he was delivering legislation allowing people who had arrived illegally to be removed from the UK.</p> \\n<p>However, Downing Street said it opposed a short bill introduced on Wednesday by the Tory backbencher Jonathan Gullis to allow the government to remove asylum seekers even if that went against against the judgment of the European court, which oversees the implementation of the convention, or other international law.</p> \\n<p>The proposal, which Gullis said would ensure “parliament, not unaccountable foreign judges in Europe, have the final say” on the UK’s asylum system, was backed by the former prime minister, Boris Johnson, and other senior Tory MPs, including Priti Patel, the former home secretary and architect of the Rwanda scheme.</p> \\n<p>In practice, there was little prospect of the bill becoming law but it once again threw a spotlight on the issue, putting pressure on the prime minister to make good on previous promises that he would not allow the ECHR to “inhibit our ability to properly control our borders”.</p> \\n<p>It follows Sunak’s pledge to “abolish” the backlog of asylum claims by the end of 2023 and set out a new plan to tackle the migration crisis, including a “small boats operational command” and a returns agreement with Albania.</p> \\n<p>Gullis’s bid was rejected by MPs by 188 votes to 69, but the scale of support it attracted from the Conservative benches highlights deep splits within the party, with dozens of MPs, many of them representing red wall seats and enough to overturn the prime minister’s majority, pressing for him to toughen up his plans.</p> \\n<p>Suella Braverman, the home secretary, said at the Conservative party’s conference in October that she was in favour of withdrawing from the European convention, while other Tory MPs fear it would undermine the Good Friday agreement, which is based on the UK remaining party to the convention.</p> \\n<p>Alison Thewliss, the SNP’s home affairs spokesperson at Westminster, told the Commons that Gullis’s proposal was “dehumanising”, coming after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/14/uk-coastguard-responds-to-small-boat-incident-in-channel-search-and-rescue\">deaths of four migrants crossing the Channel</a> in small boats.</p>

people have died and 40 people have been rescued in the Channel, [Gullis] has chosen to bring forward this offensive, grubby, dangerous wee bill. He should be ashamed of himself and if he had any sense and compassion he would have withdrawn it today,” she said.</p>',\n     'wordcount': '449'},\n    'tags': [{'id': 'uk/immigration',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Immigration and asylum',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/immigration',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/immigration',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'law/european-court-of-human-rights',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'law',\n      'sectionName': 'Law',\n      'webTitle': 'European court of human rights',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/law/european-court-of-human-rights',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/law/european-court-of-human-rights',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'law/human-rights',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'law',\n      'sectionName': 'Law',\n      'webTitle': 'Human rights',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/law/human-rights',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/law/human-rights',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'law/law',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'law',\n      'sectionName': 'Law',\n      'webTitle': 'Law',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/law/law',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/law/law',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'politics/conservatives',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'politics',\n      'sectionName': 'Politics',\n      'webTitle': 'Conservatives',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/conservatives',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'politics/politics',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'politics',\n      'sectionName': 'Politics',\n      'webTitle': 'Politics',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics',\n      'references': [],\n      'description': '<p><br></p>'},\n     {'id': 'uk/uk',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'UK news',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk',\n      'references': []}],\n    'isHosted': False,\n    'pillarId': 'pillar/news',\n    'pillarName': 'News'},\n   {'id': 'uk-news/2022/dec/13/harry-and-meghans-fight-with-tabloid-bosses-rivals-the-one-with-royals',\n    'type': 'article',\n    'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n    'sectionName': 'UK news',\n    'webPublicationDate': '2022-12-13T19:06:40Z',\n    'webTitle': 'Harry and Meghan’s fight with tabloid bosses rivals the one with royals',\n    'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/13/harry-and-meghans-fight-with-tabloid-bosses-rivals-the-one-with-royals',\n    'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/dec/13/harry-and-meghans-fight-with-tabloid-bosses-rivals-the-one-with-royals',\n    'fields': {'byline': 'Jim Waterson Media editor',\n     'body': '<p>On the surface, there is the fight you can see. With Buckingham Palace bracing itself for a second tranche of the Harry and Meghan documentary on Thursday, Britain’s tabloid media have warned of the threat the renegade royals pose to the monarchy.</p> <p>But there is a fight beyond this one – where those most in peril are not members of the Windsor family, but executives at some of Britain’s leading newspapers.</p> <p>Not mentioned in the initial episodes of the Netflix series is how some of the most powerful media bosses in the UK could be dragged into a series of ongoing legal proceedings involving Prince Harry.</p> <p>The king’s son is fighting four different cases against many of the same newspapers that are leading the criticism of his documentary.</p> <p>If the claims make it to court then the spotlight will probably focus on senior staff such as the Daily Mail’s Paul Dacre, and Rebekah Brooks, the boss of Rupert Murdoch’s UK media company.</p> <p>Nathan Sparkes, who runs the press regulation campaign group Hacked Off, said the royal couple appeared determined to permanently change public attitudes towards the British tabloid industry, although this is a high-risk strategy.</p> <p>“For decades members of the royal family, and other well-known people, have been advised to avoid confrontation with the press,” Sparkes said. “This is a policy which has only entrenched the sense of power and impunity held at some newspapers. Harry and Meghan’s willingness to stand up to those publishers, and to seek to have their rights upheld in a court of law, shows that they are prepared to take a dramatically different approach.”</p> <p>Potentially the most significant legal case is the one brought by Harry against Associated Newspapers, the parent company of the Daily Mail and its sister titles. The Duke of Sussex is one of a group of prominent individuals – including Doreen Lawrence and Elton John – whose lawyers have made a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/oct/07/legal-action-doreen-lawrence-prince-harry-daily-mail\">broad range of claims</a> alleging that widespread illegality took place on behalf of the company’s journalists.</p> <p>Their allegations, which are denied by Associated Newspapers, run contrary to past statements by Paul Dacre, the current editor-in-chief of the Mail’s parent company. He told the Leveson inquiry into press ethics that his newspaper group never engaged in illegal behaviour such as phone hacking, and until now his company has avoided the costly hacking-related legal cases that have dogged rival publishers for decades. The now defunct News of the World, a jewel in Rupert Murdoch’s UK empire, died a swift death because of the scandal.</p> <p>The media analyst Alice Enders said the prince was using the legal tools at his disposal as “part of an enduring battle against the Daily Mail … it’s clear those people are enemy number one in that household and have been since the very beginning. Harry and Meghan have done more reputational damage [to British newspapers] in this Netflix global event than in any single lawsuit. They set off a missile from their base in LA that’s accomplished far more than any of these cases ever will.”</p> <p>Yet we still don’t know exactly what Harry is accusing the Mail’s parent company of doing. His legal claim was filed at the start of October and would normally have been made available for public scrutiny by now. But despite campaigning for transparency in the court system, the Mail has successfully <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/dec/02/daily-mail-seeks-to-delay-court-allegations-of-high-profile-breaches-of-privacy\">delayed the publication</a> of the detailed allegations until well after the documentary’s release.</p> <p>Previous reporting has focused on the Mail on Sunday’s coverage of communications relating to his relationship with ex-girlfriends Chelsy Davy and Natalie Pinkham. In 2019 a spokesperson for the newspaper <a href=\"https://expose.news/2019/12/11/how-prince-harrys-personal-phone-info-featured-in-suspicious-stories-for-nine-years/\">told the website Expose.News</a> it had “never knowingly” obtained information about Harry’s text messages or phone calls by any illegitimate method.</p> <p>Any future court case could require Dacre – still tipped for a peerage in Boris Johnson’s resignation honours – to give testimony and face cross-examination. This could be damaging for Dacre and the newspaper’s brand. One risk would be a repeat of the News of the World’s downfall, where concerned advertisers stop paying to promote their products in the outlet.</p> <p>Harry is also involved in a case against Murdoch’s News Group Newspapers, the parent company of the Sun and the defunct News of the World, alleging that the company hacked his phone in the 2000s.</p> <p>Although the company readily admits that voicemails on Harry’s personal mobile phone were hacked by staff at the News of the World, it insists he has waited too long to bring the claim – and denies his accusation that phone hacking also took place at the Sun.</p> <p>If he is successful in pushing the case to court – and refuses to settle before trial – it could cause problems for Brooks, who was editor of the Sun for most of the 2000s.</p> <p>None of this is cheap. Recent legal filings reveal how Harry is running up millions of pounds in legal fees that he could be forced to pay if his claims are unsuccessful.</p> <p>A similar phone-hacking case against Mirror Group Newspapers – part of the Reach media empire, which also includes the Daily Express and the Daily Star, remains ongoing. The prince has had a partial setback in his fourth case, a libel claim against the Mail on Sunday about a story regarding his security arrangements, with both sides given until January to try to find a settlement.</p> <p>“It is a tragedy that the vast majority of victims of press wrongdoing are not wealthy and do not have access to the resources available to Harry and Meghan,” Sparks said. “But if more of those in the public eye are encouraged to defend themselves as Harry and Meghan have, they will have loosened the tabloids’ grip on the privacy of everyone in the public eye.”</p>',\n

secretary ended in deadlock, with the Royal College of Nursing condemning ministers’ “belligerence” for refusing to discuss pay.</p> \\n<p>Six hundred military personnel from all three armed forces will start training to drive ambulances to cover for striking NHS workers across the UK later this month. A further 150 are being readied to act as logistical support, defence sources said, with training for both groups to start “shortly”.</p> \\n<p>After a meeting with the health secretary, Steve Barclay, the RCN’s general secretary, Pat Cullen, said there was no more on offer from the government and stressed the distress from the profession at being forced to strike.</p> \\n<p>“The government was true to its word – they would not talk to me about pay,” Cullen said. “I needed to come out of this meeting with something serious to show nurses why they should not strike this week. Regrettably, they are not getting an extra penny.</p> \\n<p>“Ministers had too little to say and I had to speak at length about the unprecedented strength of feeling in the profession. I expressed my deep disappointment at the belligerence – they have closed their books and walked away.”</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c67c5f498aeb6211b373ad7e2b286a568b95638\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c67c5f498aeb6211b373ad7e2b286a568b95638/0_32_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pat Cullen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pat Cullen, the head of the Royal College of Nursing, said she was deeply disappointed by ministers at the meeting on Monday.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>The prime minister’s spokesperson said military assistance will be “helpful” but warned there would be “significant disruption”.</p> \\n<p>He added: “Paramedics going on strike will reduce significantly the number of people that are able to respond to those calls.”</p> \\n<p>The strikes are planned for Thursday 15 and Tuesday 20 December. The Scottish government agreed a 7.5% pay deal with the Unite and Unison unions on Monday, which called off their strikes. RCN Scotland is balloting its members on the offer and is due to announce the results next week.</p> \\n<p> No 10 insisted beforehand that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/dec/11/nhs-strikes-nurses-pay\">Barclay would not discuss pay with the union’s bosses</a>.</p> \\n<p>A Downing Street spokesperson said: “Outside of pay, which we think is for an independent review body to decide, there are non-pay options to discuss with the unions. For example, there are issues affecting nurses’ morale.”</p> \\n<p>That led to an angry response from the RCN before the meeting. Patricia Marquis, the RCN’s director for England, said it was “highly likely” the union would strike if pay was not up for discussion.</p> \\n<p>The health department said the RCN had “indicated they were willing to talk” but the government’s position on pay was non-negotiable.</p> \\n<p>“Any further pay increase would mean taking money away from frontline services and reducing the 7.2 million elective [surgery] backlog,” the spokesperson said. “Mr Barclay said he would continue to engage with the RCN as we move into the pay review process for next year and on non-pay related issues.”</p> \\n<p>The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said it was “bizarre” the government was not prepared to take any further steps to prevent strikes. “I think many people watching this would be astonished – they think it’s bizarre – that between now and Wednesday we have an opportunity for the government to prevent the strike on Thursday,” he told ITV’s Peston. “All they’ve got to do is open the door and go and walk in and get around the table and talk about the issues.”</p> \\n<p>The NHS and UK Border Force have asked the military to help keep services running, but government officials said soldiers would not be able to provide all the functions of the striking workers. Train staff are among other workers due to strike.</p> \\n<p>Military personnel who provide backup for ambulance workers would be restricted by the rules of the road, the Department of Health and Social Care said. They would be able to use blue lights and drive ambulances but must not run through red lights.</p> \\n<p>Will Quince, a health minister, also said that taxis could be provided for low-risk patients. Speaking to MPs on Monday, he said: “We are looking at ways we can provide additional support for category three and category four, including things like block-booking taxis and support through community healthcare and local authority fall services and community support.”</p> \\n<p>Public service unions and employers remain deadlocked as two weeks of rolling strikes begin in the run-up to Christmas. Ministers held an emergency meeting on Monday as officials said strikes over the next few weeks were likely to cause significant disruption even if the army was called in to help.</p> \\n<p>Speaking afterwards, Oliver Dowden, the Cabinet Office minister, repeated his call for unions to call off their strikes, adding: “I don’t think most people think it is fair and reasonable to undertake these strikes.”</p> \\n<p>The Conservative MP Damian Green <a href=\"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/government-hold-cobra-meeting-amid-064056660.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANONl8lam4FysRvpEa7v2o_Wn3tc5077yh3Tc1b9Hek8Xv2FEwtofg_ywLVPa0UiSSdJuaI-k59rRspb7NHQRTwBWJmemMzmz-wyUA83U3OeYJRrUMBSbiCTREFm40fQQnb3tQDtshcE7EPSNgZUaGJiyw3xIzu9tWrzbA9Rg4UU\">has called</a> the action a “quasi-general strike”. Downing Street declined to use the same language, but a spokesperson said: “It certainly is concerning to hear talk of coordinated actions, it only seeks to exacerbate the misery it inflicts upon the public.”</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \\n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2022/12/strike-calendar/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \\n  <div>\\n   default\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Cullen said the action could be called off “right now, this very minute” if Barclay agreed to talks on pay. “Our door is absolutely wide open and it appears at the minute that theirs is totally shut,” she told ITV’s Good Morning Britain programme.</p> \\n<p>She said the RCN would be willing to meet the government through the dispute resolution service Acas if ministers did not want to speak to the union directly.</p> \\n<p>The nurses’ union said it welcomed renewed talks with Barclay. “We have replied positively to his email and we will attend in the hope the government is now serious about negotiating,” a spokesperson said.</p> \\n<p>• This article was amended on 13 December 2022 to change the headline to make clear the nurses’ strike action is planned for England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Scottish government agreed a pay deal averaging a 7.5% uplift with the Unite and Unison unions, which called off their strikes.</p>',\n     'wordcount': '963'},\n    'tags': [{'id':

'body': '<p>Health unions made a dramatic offer on Saturday night to suspend a wave of planned strikes that threatens to cripple the NHS over Christmas and the new year if ministers agree to open serious discussions over pay.</p> <p>The moves by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and the country’s biggest union, Unison, are the first signs of flexibility by either side in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/dec/07/nhs-workers-could-be-banned-from-striking-no-10-suggests\" title=\"\">dispute that has been deadlocked for weeks</a>.</p> <p>The <em>Observer</em> has been told that rather than insisting on rises that match inflation or, for nurses, exceed it by 5%, the unions would seriously consider deals similar to those that have already led to strikes being suspended in Scotland.</p> <p>There, the threat of widespread stoppages across the NHS has been lifted after health service workers were offered between 2% and 11% by the government in Holyrood, depending on grades. The deal equates to an average 7.5% uplift. </p> <p>In a statement to the <em>Observer</em>, Pat Cullen, general secretary of the RCN, which is due to pull 100,000 of its members out on strike on Thursday in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said she was prepared to “press pause” on industrial action if the health secretary, Steve Barclay, agreed to meet to thrash out a deal.</p> <p>The unions say Barclay has held only two meetings with them in the last few weeks, and on both occasions refused to discuss pay. Instead, they say, he has turned the discussion to other matters about working conditions. The RCN said it has had no communication with Barclay’s department for a week.</p> <p>“Negotiate with nurses and avoid this strike,” Cullen said. “Five times my offer to negotiate has been turned down.” She added: “I will press pause on it when the health secretary says he will negotiate seriously on our dispute this year. That means each of us giving some ground.</p> <p>“He gains nothing by ignoring the representatives of the NHS workforce. The public blames government for this dire situation, and they have to face up to it. A swift change of tactics will pay off for all concerned.”</p> <p>Strikes in Scotland <a href=\"https://www.nursingtimes.net/news/workforce/largest-health-union-suspends-strike-ballot-in-scotland-27-10-2022/\" title=\"\">have been suspended</a> after Unison recommended acceptance of the offer to its members, while the RCN has taken a neutral position and also put the new offer to the membership in a ballot.</p> <p>Unison’s general secretary, Christina McAnea, said a Scotland-style offer to NHS workers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland “could well” mean the strike threats being lifted. “Rather than scare the public about the consequences of strikes, the health secretary should table genuine plans for improving wages,” she said.</p> <p>“Sitting down with health unions and improving the pay on offer has put strikes on hold across Scotland. If Steve Barclay were to mirror Holyrood’s approach and commit to boosting wages this year, the threat of pre-Christmas strikes could well be lifted. But the ball sits firmly in the government’s court. Ministers know what they must do to prevent disruption later this month.”</p> <p>The two planned NHS-wide stoppages by nurses are due to be followed by a series of strikes by ambulance service staff who belong to Unison, Unite and the GMB unions on 21 December and by GMB members only on 28 December.</p> <p>NHS bosses are privately alarmed at the impact of stoppages by ambulance staff, given that patients are already being harmed, and in some cases dying, as a direct result of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/02/a-e-paramedics-ambulance-crews-hospitals-nhs\" title=\"\">ambulance response times</a> to 999 calls, which are already the worst on record.</p> <p>On Monday, the results of ballots for strike action involving NHS midwives and physiotherapists will be made public as action among health workers threatens to spread.</p> <p>In Friday’s <em>Guardian,</em> Cullen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/dec/09/rcn-nurses-union-leader-pat-cullen-i-follow-through-on-what-i-believe-in\" title=\"\">described Barclay as a “bullyboy”</a> over his refusal to negotiate. But she also gave a clear indication that the RCN would drop its months-long pursuit of a pay rise worth 5% above inflation if the health secretary abandoned his insistence the government cannot afford to improve on its offer of an uplift of at least £1,400 a head for 2022-23.</p> <p>If talks about pay did happen, “negotiations will inevitably involve some give and take on each side. I won’t dig in if they won’t dig in. But they need to come to the table with me,” said Cullen. She repeated her willingness to revisit the union’s pay claim if Barclay does enter into talks.</p> <p>The government’s offer is worth about 4% to more than 1 million workers – everyone bar doctors and dentists – whose terms and conditions are set under the longstanding Agenda for Change UK-wide agreement. However, if ministers were to increase that, they would have to find a potentially significant amount of extra money to ensure a deal, as each 1% extra on NHS staff pay costs about £700m.</p> <p>Labour has indicated over recent days that it backs a more generous deal for NHS workers and accused the government of “spoiling for a fight” with the unions by denouncing them for “holding Christmas to ransom”. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the shadow health secretary accused the British Medical Association (BMA) of being “hostile” and promised to take on “vested interests” to reform the NHS.</p> <p>In an interview with the <em>Telegraph</em> newspaper, Labour’s Wes Streeting said: “Given that we have committed to more staff, I cannot for the life of me understand why the BMA is so hostile to the idea that with more staff must come better standards for patients.</p> <p>“Whenever I point out the appalling state of access to primary care – where currently a record 2 million people are waiting more than a month to see a GP – I am treated like some sort of heretic by the BMA, who seem to think any criticism of patient access to primary care is somehow an attack on GPs.”</p> <p>Streeting also criticised what he called “defensive attitudes” and vowed Labour will not have a “something-for-nothing culture in the NHS”.</p> <p>He said: “I think the BMA does doctors no favours when they vote for motions that look like they’re living on a different planet and, worst of all, aren’t really thinking about the best interests of patients.”</p> <p>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “NHS workers do an incredible job caring for our loved ones and it is disappointing some will be taking industrial action, ahead of a difficult winter.</p> <p>“Ministers have had constructive talks with unions, including the RCN and Unison, on how we can make the NHS a better place to work – and have been clear the door remains open for further talks.”</p> <p><em>Additional reporting: Nadeem Badshah</em></p> <p>• This article was amended on 16 December 2022 to correct a reference to the pay increase offered to health service workers in Scotland. An earlier version said they had been offered between 5% and 11%; while that is the range for most, the uplift for those on higher grades starts at 2%.

Shouldn’t we be discussing something <em>important</em>, she asked. Never mind that she and her UK media colleagues had spent the preceding week speculating about the Sussexes’ new Netflix documentary. Earlier that morning, the first three episodes had finally dropped and already those same journalists and outlets were talking the series down.</p> <p>I demurred: the documentary was compelling, perhaps in some respects even important. The radio host waved away my comment. She had better things to do with her time, she declared, with the performative distaste Very Serious People typically reserve for <em>Strictly Come Dancing</em>.</p> <p>Of course, she had a point. The news cycle that day, as most days, was grim. Iran had just <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-63900099\" title=\"\">executed a man</a> convicted for participating in anti-government protests sparked by the state’s murder and repression of women. Surely this fresh atrocity should have led every bulletin.</p> <p>Yet the idea that the documentary deserved to hit the headlines only because people were chattering about it, as another interviewer insisted, was wide of the mark too. For one thing, disdaining the royals as a branch of light entertainment overlooks their power and influence. In more than a few of the 14 overseas realms, the debate about whether to retain King Charles as head of state is urgent and sophisticated, weighing the monarchy’s problematic history against any value that it adds, and the costs and risks (more acute than ever in a world of surging far-right populism) of change.</p> <p>In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, such discussions also bubble up. In Westminster politics, they are relegated to the fringes. The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, for example, has affirmed his party’s commitment to deep constitutional reforms, including the <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2022-12-05/labour-would-abolish-indefensible-house-of-lords-pledges-starmer\" title=\"\">abolition of the “indefensible” House of Lords</a>. It might seem perverse to object to one unelected and partially hereditary institution of state without at least considering the future of a purely hereditary one, but that is the course Starmer has signalled by accepting his knighthood in 2014 and in his more recent statements of support for the monarchy.</p> <p>In England, republican zeal is conspicuous by its absence. So is Prince Harry. The Sussexes’ exit confirmed a widespread misapprehension that the couple are a sideshow to the monarchy, rather than central to its fate and future. The real question, though, isn’t whether Harry or his children are likely one day to reign – he is fifth in line to the throne, with son Archie and daughter Lilibet respectively sixth and seventh. It’s whether and how many future generations of Windsors will follow Charles, and what the failure of the institution to retain its first mixed-race members says about attitudes within its ranks, as well as in the media and wider society.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aaef172043e909a0cc2d430527e6a7cf1e60562e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aaef172043e909a0cc2d430527e6a7cf1e60562e/0_0_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Many members of the royal family on the main balcony at Buckingham Palace, all looking up at a flypast\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A flypast at Trooping the Colour in 2016. The royals are disdained as entertainment, but wield influence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Ireland/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first tranche of the series contains useful context: David Olusoga and Afua Hirsch knitting together the legacy of empire and Brexit that saw the two sides of a painful family split become opposing proxies in the culture wars; Harry and Meghan describing how it feels to be prey for the press; Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland, for the first time speaking, with eloquence, for herself. The final three episodes, due to stream from Thursday, will presumably rehearse the couple’s allegation of racism by a member of the royal family, first made during their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/mar/06/harry-meghan-oprah-interview\" title=\"\">2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey</a>. There had, said Meghan, been “concerns and conversations about how dark [Archie’s] skin might be”.</p> <p>Polls show that the couple’s departure, and the subsequent explanations for it, have turned some younger and more diverse demographics, briefly won over to the royal family by Harry and Meghan’s union, against the monarchy. The few prominent commentators who have attempted to articulate this effect – or merely voice discomfort with the nasty, polarised debate around the Sussexes – regularly find themselves invited on daytime TV to be shouted down, gaslit or <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/03/piers-morgan-racism-meghan-markle-prince-harry-oprah-interview-good-morning-britain\" title=\"\">accused of race-baiting</a> in return.</p> <p>It doesn’t help that Meghan is an imperfect victim, not always consistent in her accounts and prone to flourishes. Her re-enactment for Netflix of curtseying to the Queen instantly drew ire, real and confected, for supposed disrespect to the memory of her grandmother-in-law. Nobody curtsies like that, critics harrumphed. They’re wrong. When I was researching my biography of King Charles, I discovered his female staff were running a competition to see who could perform the deepest curtsey without falling over. A former girlfriend of his also confided that protocol demanded she curtsey to him, leading one evening to a clash of heads when he mistimed an attempt to kiss her.</p> <p>A far more serious charge against Meghan is that <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/royal-aides-reveal-meghan-bullying-claim-before-oprah-interview-7sxfvd2c3\" title=\"\">she bullied palace staff</a>, a story deliberately placed with journalists just before the Sussexes’ Winfrey interview. When I heard some of these allegations in the summer of 2018, I hadn’t written about the royals for a couple of years and this wasn’t a strategic leak. Even taking account of mitigating factors – cultural misunderstandings, a barrage of sexist and racist media attacks at exactly the moment that royal convention denied Meghan a voice, the bias that sees women of colour as angrier than their white counterparts – it’s clear there were clashes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5a636d2ed9927eb20063b29e0215e1be4b8b271a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a636d2ed9927eb20063b29e0215e1be4b8b271a/0_0_3000_4721/635.jpg\" alt=\"A full length photograph of Charles and Camilla in formal dress\" width=\"635\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The king and the queen consort: a royal insider has described Charles as the ‘least racist’ of the royals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Jackson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It’s equally clear that the institution itself has a dismal record of protecting the people who live and work within its walls. The court can be brutal: bristling with plots, “Wolf Hall” in the words of one source, staff bound by NDAs, their complaints hushed up, while royals and their favourites strut and bellow.</p> <p>Whatever Meghan did or didn’t do, her experience of racism should be believed, not least because it’s always been there in plain sight. The Netflix documentary serves up one example: the decision by Princess Michael of Kent <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42462724\" title=\"\">to wear a “blackamoor” brooch</a> to lunch with Harry’s then fiancee and other royals.</p> <p>When I began probing the question of which family member might have made the comment about Archie’s skin, an insider described Charles as “the least racist royal” and meant this as a compliment. The King’s charities and initiatives have brought him into contact with a wider range of people than many of his relatives, but these perspectives have never been embedded in his household, which, like the whole organisation, tends to homogeneity.</p> <p>Mandu Reid, the leader of the Women’s Equality party, an organisation which, as it happens, I co-founded, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/01/lady-hussey-resign-monarchy-race-remarks-institution?CMP=share_btn_tw\" title=\"\">witnessed this phenomenon in action</a> at a Buckingham Palace reception last month intended to highlight violence against women and girls. The event instead drew attention to Lady Susan Hussey, woman of the bedchamber to the late Queen, and by then part of the queen consort’s retinue. Reid watched Hussey interrogate another guest – Ngozi Fulani, the head of the charity Sistah Space – about where Fulani came from, seeming to refuse, in time-dishonoured tradition, to accept that Fulani was British. After the story blew up each woman suffered consequences. Hussey resigned, enabling officials to spin her as an outlier of palace culture.

Instead, the advice from the palace was: “Don’t say anything.”</p> \\n<p>“So, it was almost like a rite of passage, and some of the members of the royal family were like: ‘My wife had to go through that, so why should your girlfriend be treated any differently? Why should you get special treatment? Why should she be protected?’” Harry told the six-part docuseries, Harry &amp; Meghan.</p> \\n<p>“I said: ‘The difference here is the race element.’”</p> \\n<p>The documentary opened with a written statement on screen: “Members of the royal family declined to comment on the content within this series.” </p> \\n<p>It is understood from sources that Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace did receive an email from an unknown production company that did not address the entire series. Attempts to verify its authenticity through the Sussex’s Archewell Productions and Netflix received no response, however, so they were unable to provide any response.</p> \\n<p>The couple’s main attack was focused on the media. Harry, filming himself as he left the UK for the last time as a senior royal, said he felt “being part of this family, it is my duty to uncover this exploitation and bribery that happens within our media”. Meghan, filming herself in Vancouver, said: “Unfortunately, in us standing for something, they are destroying us.”</p> \\n<p>Images of newspaper headlines flashed up on the screen included: “Harry’s girl is (almost) straight outta Compton”. Meghan said: “Firstly, I’m not from Compton, I’ve never lived in Compton, so it’s factually incorrect. But why do you have to make a dig at Compton?”</p> \\n<p>Other headlines shown in the documentary included “One’s gone GangstER”, and another saying Meghan’s ancestors were a “tailor, a teacher and a cleaner in racially divided Jim Crow South”.</p> \\n<p>Speaking about the press coverage, Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland, said paparazzi would take pictures of deprived neighbourhoods in Los Angeles. “They would take pictures of different parts of, say, Skid Row, and say that is where I lived and that is where she was from,” Ragland told the documentary.</p> \\n<p>“It was horrible,” Meghan said. “But I continued to hold the line. Say nothing.”</p> \\n<p>Ragland said she warned her daughter about race. “I said, ‘You may not want to hear this, but this is what’s coming down the pike.’”</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2022/dec/08/harry-meghan-netflix-documentary-royal-family-media-reaction-live-updates\">Harry &amp; Meghan live: Duke of Sussex compares his wife to Princess Diana in Netflix documentary </a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>On speaking out, Harry said: “My son, my daughter, my children are mixed race, and I’m really proud of that. When my kids grow up, and they look back at this moment, and they turn to me and say, ‘What did you do in this moment?’, I want to be able to give them an answer.”</p> \\n<p>He also spoke about what he called the Windsors’ “unconscious bias” as the documentary showed images of Princess Michael of Kent wearing a blackamoor-style brooch to a Christmas lunch attended by Meghan in 2017, for which she later apologised. “In this family, sometimes you are part of the problem rather than part of the solution. There is a huge level of unconscious bias,” Harry said.</p> \\n<p>Meghan said the UK media “wanted my mum’s side of my family to be the ones that all this drama could be stirred up with and they just had my mum who is classy and quiet, and then you have the other side of my family that is just acting differently”, referring to the family from which she is estranged.</p> \\n<p>Harry “shouldered” responsibility for the breakdown of Meghan’s relationship with her estranged father, Thomas Markle, after he staged media photographs ahead of the couple’s 2018 wedding, which he did not attend because of ill health. Describing it as “incredibly sad”, Harry said: “She had a father before this and now she doesn’t have a father. And I shouldered that because if Meg wasn’t with me, then her dad would still be her dad.”</p> \\n<p>Harry said his family were impressed when they met Meghan. “But the fact that I was dating an American actress was probably what clouded their judgment more than anything else at the beginning: ‘Oh, she’s an American actress; this won’t last.’”</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/06/sussex-lies-and-videotape-papers-on-the-attack-over-harry-and-meghan-documentary\">‘Sussex, lies and videotape’: papers on the attack over Harry and Meghan documentary</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>Their dating days were described by Harry as a “combination of car chases, anti-surveillance driving and disguises”. Meghan was stalked by media in Toronto while filming Suits, and “salacious” stories were planted by the press, the couple said.</p> \\n<p>Describing the pressure leading up to their wedding, Meghan spoke of the “orchestrated reality show” of the couple’s engagement announcement and interviews, and how they were coached by the palace communications team, but unable to speak of the pressures they felt under at the time.</p> \\n<p>She was told the media coverage would improve after their wedding. “But truth be told, no matter how hard I tried, no matter how good I was, no matter what I did, they were still going to find a way to destroy me,” she said.</p> \\n<p>Speaking of the royal rota (members of the media specifically accredited to cover the royals), Harry said: “All royal news goes through the filter of all newspapers within the royal rota, most of which, apart from the Telegraph, happen to be tabloids.</p> \\n<p>“It all comes down to control, it’s like: ‘This family is ours to exploit. Their trauma is our story, and our story and our narrative to control.’”</p> \\n<p>He described the royal rota as “essentially an extended PR arm of the royal family”.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \\n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f3e239d0-1b3c-4c8d-b346-25c73cc4504b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pbixAzhDLrU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<p>The docuseries controversially used footage from Diana, Princess of Wales’s Panorama interview, which Prince William has insisted should never be aired again. Harry said the majority of his early memories were of “being swarmed by paparazzi”. He did not, he revealed, have “many early memories of my mum. It was almost like internally I sort of blocked them.”</p> \\n<p>In lighter moments, Meghan described her first encounter with the late Queen, likening the formality of the royal court as something from medieval times, where bowing and curtseying were “a big deal”. She said: “I mean, Americans will understand this … We have Medieval Times Dinner &amp; Tournament. It was like that.”</p> \\n<p>Of their relationship, Harry said: “This is a great love story. And the craziest thing is that I think this love story is only just getting started.</p> \\n<p>“She sacrificed everything that she ever knew, the freedom that she had, to join me in my world, and then pretty soon after that I end up sacrificing everything that I know to join her in her world.” </p> \\n<p>The final three episodes of the series will be released on Thursday 15 December.</p>',\n     'wordcount': '1136'},\n    'tags': [{'id': 'uk/prince-harry',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Prince Harry',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-harry',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/prince-harry',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk-news/meghan-duchess-of-sussex',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/meghan-duchess-of-sussex',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/meghan-duchess-of-sussex',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/monarchy',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Monarchy',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/monarchy',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/monarchy',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'media/media',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'media',\n      'sectionName': 'Media',\n      'webTitle': 'Media',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/media/media',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/media/media',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'media/newspapers',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'media',\n      'sectionName': 'Media',\n      'webTitle': 'Newspapers',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/media/newspapers',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/media/newspapers',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'media/pressandpublishing',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'media',\n      'sectionName': 'Media',\n      'webTitle': 'Newspapers & magazines',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/media/pressandpublishing',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/media/pressandpublishing',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/uk',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'UK news',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk',\n      'references': []}],\n    'isHosted': False,\n    'pillarId': 'pillar/news',\n    'pillarName': 'News'},\n   {'id': 'uk-news/2022/dec/08/outraged-media-outlets-use-sussex-series-readers-harry-meghan',\n    'type': 'article',\n    'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n    'sectionName': 'UK news',\n    'webPublicationDate': '2022-12-08T15:06:37Z',\n    'webTitle': 'Media outlets outraged over Meghan and Harry series run wall-to-wall coverage',\n    'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/08/outraged-media-outlets-use-sussex-series-readers-harry-meghan',\n    'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/dec/08/outraged-media-outlets-use-sussex-series-readers-harry-meghan',\n    'fields': {'byline': 'Jim Waterson Media editor',\n     'body': '<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s Netflix documentary is highly critical of the British media – but the programme is sending millions of readers to the same news outlets they criticise in the film.</p> <p>Many of the newspapers that have denounced the royal couple for making a Netflix documentary about themselves are also providing wall-to-wall coverage about the contents of the same documentary.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/08/prince-harry-royals-meghan-racial-attacks-duke-duchess-sussex-netflix\">Prince Harry: royals didn’t understand risk to Meghan of racial attacks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Within two hours of the release of the first episodes, the <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.html\">top 12 stories on MailOnline</a> were all about the couple, complete with pictures, gifs, and screengrabs. <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/\">The Sun</a> managed seven stories about the couple online within the first two hours.</p> <p>Articles about the couple drive an enormous numbers of clicks to news websites, making them a top subject for sites that rely on online advertising to make money, with every angle covered. This interest results in intense competition to be the news outlet with the top Google search result for terms such as “Meghan Markle” or “Prince Harry”.</p> <p>The documentary was released at midnight in California – where both Netflix and the couple are based – but this means it came out at 8am in the UK, perfect timing for British news outlets to enjoy a full day of coverage. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2022/dec/08/harry-meghan-netflix-documentary-royal-family-media-reaction-live-updates\">The Guardian</a> also ran a live blog summarising the claims the couple made in the programme.</p> <p>Piers Morgan, who lost his job on ITV’s Good Morning Britain after refusing to apologise for comments about Meghan, has never let his fixation drop. Despite expressing outrage at the couple’s decision to make the documentary, he has no intention of ignoring it. His team have already press-released that he will dedicate the entire hour of his TalkTV programme to the show. The Duchess of Sussex’s stepbrother and the former royal butler Paul Burrell have been booked to appear alongside him.</p> <p>TalkTV promised fury, pointing out that in the past his “fiery opinions” have previously led to him “dramatically walking off air”. “So, there’s bound to be fireworks as Britain’s most outspoken broadcaster gives his uncensored thoughts on the royal pair and their fly-on-the wall series.”</p> <p>In the series Prince Harry says the media criticism can be overwhelming. He claimed the wider royal family felt that criticism of Meghan – after her relationship with the prince became public – was “like a rite of passage”. He suggested the royal family failed to account for the “race element” in the coverage of his new girlfriend.</p> <p>He also explicitly rejected the traditional way that the royal family handled the relationship with royal correspondents at British newspapers and broadcasters: “All royal news goes through the filter of all newspapers within the royal rota, most of which, apart from the Telegraph, happen to be tabloids. It all comes down to control, it’s like: ‘This family is ours to exploit. Their trauma is our story, and our story and our narrative to control.’”</p> <p>For the first time there will also be a sense of how many Britons watched the programme, after the independent audience measuring organisation Barb started releasing viewing figures for individual Netflix programmes last month.</p> <p>Despite scrutiny of the editing techniques used in the programme – such as using stock images of photographers from other events to illustrate sections where the couple talk about the media – there is no easy way for British television viewers to complain.</p> <p>UK viewers have the ability to raise complaints to the media regulator, Ofcom, if they feel a programme on a traditional broadcaster such as BBC or ITV is substantially misleading. But streaming services operating in the UK such as Netflix are not covered by the same tough rules. Instead, as <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/news-centre/2022/does-ofcom-regulate-netflix?utm_source=tw_article&amp;utm_medium=social_org&amp;utm_campaign=netflixreg\">Ofcom has clarified</a> following a number of complaints, Netflix is overseen by the Dutch media regulator.</p> <p>Even under the Ofcom code, any breach regarding use of stock images or footage for illustrative purposes would need be considered “materially misreading” to count as a breach of broadcasting rules. There is a relatively high bar for breaches of accuracy in non-news programmes and it would need to be proven that a programme “materially misleads the audience so as to cause harm or offence”.</p>',\n     'wordcount': '680'},\n    'tags': [{'id': 'uk/prince-harry',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Prince

coronation at Westminster Abbey.</p> <p>It includes the four quarters of the Royal Arms depicted within a shield, and between each shield an emblem of the home nations: a rose, a thistle, a shamrock and a leek.</p> <p>All UK coins bearing the effigy of Queen Elizabeth II will remain legal tender and in active circulation.</p> <p>A commemorative version of the coin was released in October, generating record visitors to the Royal Mint’s website in the 24 hours after.</p> <p>A total of 4.9m 50p coins will enter circulation across 9,452 Post Office branches throughout December. Coins will be distributed as change when customers make purchases.</p> <p>In line with demand, 9.6m 50p coins will eventually enter circulation.</p> <p>Rebecca Morgan, director of collector services at the Royal Mint, said: “Today marks a new era for UK coinage, with the effigy of King Charles III appearing on 50ps in circulation.</p> <p>“It’s a fantastic opportunity for coin collectors to add to their collections, or start one for the first time.</p> <p>“We anticipate a new generation of coin collectors emerging, with people keeping a close eye on their change to try to spot a new 50p that bears the portrait of our new king.</p> <p>“The Royal Mint has been trusted to make coins bearing the monarch’s effigy for over 1,100 years and we are proud to continue this tradition into the reign of King Charles III.”</p> <p>Nick Read, chief executive of the Post Office, added: “It is a tremendous honour for the Post Office and for postmasters that the first coinage featuring King Charles III is being released into circulation via our extensive branch network.</p> <p>“December is our busiest time of the year so the coin will be entering our network in a phased manner. If you don’t receive the new 50p in your change on your first visit to a post office you may well get it in your change in a subsequent visit, so keep a look out for it.”</p>',\n     'wordcount': '393'},\n    'tags': [{'id': 'uk/prince-charles',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'King Charles III',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-charles',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/prince-charles',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'money/money',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'money',\n      'sectionName': 'Money',\n      'webTitle': 'Money',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/money/money',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/money/money',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/monarchy',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Monarchy',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/monarchy',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/monarchy',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/queen',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Queen Elizabeth II',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/queen',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/queen',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/uk',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'UK news',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'business/post-office',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'business',\n      'sectionName': 'Business',\n      'webTitle': 'Post Office',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/post-office',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/business/post-office',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'business/currencies',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'business',\n      'sectionName': 'Business',\n      'webTitle': 'Currencies',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/currencies',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/business/currencies',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'business/business',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'business',\n      'sectionName': 'Business',\n      'webTitle': 'Business',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/business',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/business/business',\n      'references': []}],\n    'isHosted': False,\n    'pillarId': 'pillar/news',\n    'pillarName': 'News'},\n   {'id': 'uk-news/2022/dec/06/sussex-lies-and-videotape-papers-on-the-attack-over-harry-and-meghan-documentary',\n    'type': 'article',\n    'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n    'sectionName': 'UK news',\n    'webPublicationDate': '2022-12-06T19:23:12Z',\n    'webTitle': '‘Sussex, lies and videotape’: papers on the attack over Harry and Meghan documentary',\n    'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/06/sussex-lies-and-videotape-papers-on-the-attack-over-harry-and-meghan-documentary',\n    'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/dec/06/sussex-lies-and-videotape-papers-on-the-attack-over-harry-and-meghan-documentary',\n    'fields': {'byline': 'Jim Waterson Media editor',\n     'body': '<p>With just days to go until the Duke and Duchess of Sussex release their Netflix series, newspapers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/05/prince-harry-women-marrying-royal-family-meghan-netflix\">are turning a documentary about how the media treated the couple</a> into a story about how the couple are treating the media.</p> <p>Monday’s release of a second trailer promoting the show has already led to suggestions of misleading editing, with several photos and clips taken out of context in the promotional video for the six-part show entitled Harry and Meghan.</p> <p>“There’s a leaking but there’s also planting of stories … It’s a dirty game,” says Prince Harry in the trailer, as flashbulbs break over a variety of archive and stock images.</p> <p>The Sun – one of the publications singled out in the trailer – ran the story on its front page under the headline “Sussex, lies and videotape”. While some of the manipulations are small – a photo of Harry surrounded by paparazzi was cropped from an old picture with his ex Chelsy Davy, rather than with Meghan – some are more unusual. Two pieces of footage showing a scrum of cameras are taken from very different stories. One is from outside a magistrates court in Sussex where cameras were waiting to catch the glamour model Katie Price, another is footage of Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen leaving his New York apartment.</p> <p>Another shot showing dozens of photographers with long-lens cameras jostling for position was in reality taken outside a Harry Potter film premiere in 2011. It is one of the top results for “paparazzi” on a popular stock image website.</p> <p>Robert Jobson, the Evening Standard’s royal editor, criticised another dramatic shot of a photographer’s lens peering down on the couple with their newborn child Archie. Jobson insisted it was taken with their approval by an accredited press photographer at Archbishop Tutu’s residence in Cape Town. He tweeted: “Only three people were in the accredited position. H &amp; M [Harry and Meghan] agreed the position. I was there.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/theroyaleditor/status/1599799660335472641\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This photograph used by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/netflix?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Netflix</a> and Harry and Meghan to suggest intrusion by the press is a complete travesty.

And the ITN Productions camera filming the Sussexes’ Africa documentary was there with their permission. It was not a media scrum. They spoke to [ITV news anchor] Tom Bradby inside.”</p> <p>The issue, in part, is whether this still felt like press intrusion to the couple – even if it was done with the approval of their then aides. Netflix declined to comment on suggestions the footage was misleading.</p> <p>Because the show is being made for Netflix – rather than a British television channel – it is not bound by the UK’s broadcast standards code. Under British rules, which are overseen by Ofcom, factual programmes “must not materially mislead the audience” or risk being in breach.</p> <p>Whether using stock images of camera scrums to illustrate press intrusion would count as a material breach of those rules is unclear. But British television executives live in fear of repeating the BBC’s 2007 mistake, when a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jul/12/broadcastingethics.bbc\">misleading trailer</a> apparently showed Queen Elizabeth II storming out of a photoshoot with Annie Liebowitz and incident which led to the resignation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/oct/06/themonarchy.bbc\">BBC One’s then controller, Peter Fincham</a>.</p> <p>It may not help coverage of the Sussexes that they are suing the majority of British newspaper proprietors on various grounds, having long ago dropped any pretence that they wish to abide by the traditional rules of royal media engagement. Harry is bringing phone-hacking cases against both News UK (which owns the Sun and the Times) and Reach (which owns the Mirror, Express, and Daily Star). He is also one of a number of prominent individuals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/oct/06/doreen-lawrence-prince-harry-and-others-launch-legal-action-against-daily-mail-publisher\">who are making serious allegations against Associated Newspapers</a>, the publisher of the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday, and MailOnline.</p> <p>Meghan has already won a separate legal case against the Mail on Sunday after it published a private letter she sent to her father. Only the parent companies of the Guardian, Daily Telegraph and the Financial Times are not publicly known to be involved in legal battles with the couple.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Harry paused a separate libel battle against the Mail on Sunday. He says a story they ran about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/24/prince-harry-launches-libel-action-against-mail-on-sunday\">funding for his security team</a> is libellous but the Mail’s publisher is contesting the claim on the basis the article expressed an “honest opinion” and did not cause serious reputational harm.</p> <p>In a sign of the enormous sums that Harry is willing to spend on these legal cases, the court heard the royal has already paid £340,000 in legal fees for this single case and has budgeted up to £1.2m if the case goes to trial. The two sides will continue negotiations to reach a settlement until 20 January next year – by which point all six episodes of Harry and Meghan, setting out their views on the British media, will have been seen by millions.</p>',\n     'wordcount': '798'},\n    'tags': [{'id': 'uk/prince-harry',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Prince Harry',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-harry',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/prince-harry',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk-news/meghan-duchess-of-sussex',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/meghan-duchess-of-sussex',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/meghan-duchess-of-sussex',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/uk',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'UK news',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'media/media',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'media',\n      'sectionName': 'Media',\n      'webTitle': 'Media',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/media/media',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/media/media',\n      'references': []}],\n    'isHosted': False,\n    'pillarId': 'pillar/news',\n    'pillarName': 'News'},\n   {'id': 'uk-news/2022/dec/05/prince-harry-women-marrying-royal-family-meghan-netflix',\n    'type': 'article',\n    'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n    'sectionName': 'UK news',\n    'webPublicationDate': '2022-12-05T13:42:00Z',\n    'webTitle': 'Prince Harry speaks of ‘suffering’ of women marrying into royal family',\n    'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/05/prince-harry-women-marrying-royal-family-meghan-netflix',\n    'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/dec/05/prince-harry-women-marrying-royal-family-meghan-netflix',\n    'fields': {'byline': 'Jamie Grierson',\n     'body': '<p>Prince Harry has highlighted the “pain and suffering” of women marrying into the British royal family, in a new trailer for the Sussexes’ highly anticipated behind-the-scenes docuseries.</p> \\n<p>Netflix has promised an “unprecedented and in-depth documentary series” over six episodes where the couple “share the other side of their high-profile love story”.</p> \\n<p>Volume one of the series will launch this Thursday – exactly three months after the death of Harry’s grandmother Queen Elizabeth II – with the second volume to be released on 15 December.</p> \\n<p>A new one-minute teaser video opens with a voiceover by Harry saying: “It’s really hard to look back on it now and go: ‘What on earth happened?’”</p> \\n<p>He continues the narration throughout, saying: “There’s a hierarchy of the family, you know, there’s leaking, but there’s also planting of stories.

On Saturday, the <em>Boston Globe</em> declared approvingly: “Royals, and Biden, and Beckham – Oh my!” The city, it said, “truly became the hub of the universe”.</p> <p>The headlines reflected conflicting and often generationally divided interpretations of the royal brand in the US. Some of that could be ascribed to the Sussexes. At the time of the Waleses’ last visit, in 2014, Harry and Meghan hadn’t even met, Chernock notes. “Now we have a new couple who have created an element of surprise and volatility.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e821557c37ad4ba71ee83d32b55cdfc496c5a92b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e821557c37ad4ba71ee83d32b55cdfc496c5a92b/3_0_4193_2516/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry and Meghan have claimed racial insensitivity within the palace walls.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry and Meghan have claimed racial insensitivity within the palace walls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Prince Harry and Meghan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The long history of British royals coming to America, from King George VI’s trip to see FDR in June 1939 – to shore up support as a war with Nazi Germany loomed – to Queen Elizabeth II on horseback with Ronald Reagan, and Princess Diana dancing with John Travolta is typically laden with diplomatic messaging.</p> <p>Highlights of this trip included Caroline Kennedy, now US ambassador to Australia, acting as William’s guide – an endorsement in act and spirit from a complicated family closest to being considered US royalty – at the JFK library on Friday. Later, the Waleses arrived at an Earthshot environmental initiative award ceremony in an electric car, the princess in a $100 green dress and hand-me-down necklace. Earlier, President Biden had welcomed the couple, and shared, according to a spokesperson, “warm memories of Her Majesty”.</p> <p>The complications of this visit, Chernock says, “are not what William and Kate are doing – it’s everything that’s happening around them that makes it harder to move through these pre-determined roles and schedules and requires a new degree of savvy and humility that perhaps the royal family is not accustomed to”.</p> <p>Still, Chernock said, the couple “have been received with great enthusiasm because they have demonstrated just how serious they are about a number of issues that really resonate with multiple publics”.</p> <p>While a spokesperson for the Prince of Wales stated that Hussey’s comments were unacceptable and that “racism has no place in our society”, the latest racially tinged blow-up called for the Waleses to address it directly, Chernock says.</p> <p>“Obviously, William and Kate did not make the remarks but they can’t just brush it under the rug because it’s not a one-off. There’s a desire on the part of Americans for more candour, a more robust response – and to show willingness to lead on issues of racial justice that keep coming up.”</p> <p>But that could just as easily be turned into an opportunity for the couple to “demonstrate they are going to take a stronger stand on these issues and set a new tone”. Without the couple seeking to put down markers of a generational divide, they’d be “continuing a pattern where silence means something and that becomes equated with complicity”.</p> <p>Despite the increasingly public spat between the Waleses and Sussexes, conducted(as their parents had done) through royal “sources” as well as the release of the Netflix trailer, the values that the two couples champion – environmental and racial justice – are closely intertwined. “William and Kate’s agenda doesn’t need to be at odds with Harry and Meghan’s. In fact they’re very much aligned,” says Chernock. But with the Sussexes staked out in California, they are “an additional dimension the Waleses need to be aware of, but not actively manage, when they come to America”. </p> <p>The pride that many in the US felt that an American woman was marrying into the British royal family is now tinged with a sense of protectiveness that Meghan had been wronged. “That lends to a sense of wariness about others in the family,” Chernock said.</p> <p>Still, she added, the resonances of last week’s visit were fascinating. “It’s unfortunate that the more the press forwards the narrative of a war, the more they’re doing a disservice to the royal family but also to the issues that are of global import.”</p>',\n     'wordcount': '836'},\n    'tags': [{'id': 'uk/prince-william',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Prince William',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-william',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/prince-william',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/duchess-of-cambridge',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Catherine, Princess of Wales',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/duchess-of-cambridge',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/duchess-of-cambridge',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/prince-harry',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Prince Harry',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-harry',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/prince-harry',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/monarchy',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'Monarchy',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/monarchy',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/monarchy',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'us-news/us-news',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'us-news',\n      'sectionName': 'US news',\n      'webTitle': 'US news',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-news',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/us-news',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'uk/uk',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n      'sectionName': 'UK news',\n      'webTitle': 'UK news',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk',\n      'references': []},\n     {'id': 'world/world',\n      'type': 'keyword',\n      'sectionId': 'world',\n      'sectionName': 'World news',\n      'webTitle': 'World news',\n      'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/world',\n      'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/world',\n      'references': []}],\n    'isHosted': False,\n    'pillarId': 'pillar/news',\n    'pillarName': 'News'},\n   {'id': 'uk-news/2022/dec/02/william-kate-seek-end-us-trip-positive-note-turbulent-week-royal-family',\n    'type': 'article',\n    'sectionId': 'uk-news',\n    'sectionName': 'UK news',\n    'webPublicationDate': '2022-12-02T13:42:37Z',\n    'webTitle': 'William and Kate seek to end US trip on positive note after turbulent week',\n    'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/02/william-kate-seek-end-us-trip-positive-note-turbulent-week-royal-family',\n    'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/dec/02/william-kate-seek-end-us-trip-positive-note-turbulent-week-royal-family',\n    'fields': {'byline': 'Caroline Davies',\n     'body': '<p>The Prince and Princess of Wales are due to end their three-day trip to Boston on a high note, having landed in the middle of a palace racism row and then been blindsided by a trailer for the Sussexes’ documentary.</p> \\n<p>A meeting with Joe Biden, and a star-studded award ceremony for Prince William’s environmental <a href=\"https://earthshotprize.org/\">Earthshot prize</a>, were scheduled to round off what could be described as a bumpy few days.</p> \\n<p>On Friday evening William met the US president, shaking hands and chatting near the John F Kennedy Memorial Library and Museum.
